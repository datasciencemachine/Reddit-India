"Wait for straw, sipper gets longer for Stan Swamy, who has Parkinson’s disease and is in Jail",,Politics," My father has parkinson's and all I can say is that this shit is disgusting What draconian system can't provide a prisoner with a straw for medical reasons? Forget if the prisoner is innocent or not. Not to mention that this is someone who has been fighting for people who has been oppressed by the state. On the one hand we have leaders crying foul for someone like Arnab and on the other hand, the government is arresting academics, activists and killing journalists. I have zero hope Aren't there any rights for prisoners im matters like this? Someone couriered a sipper to Taloja jail, and apparently the jail authorities have refused to accept it. We need a  campaign where people  start mailing hundreds or thousands of sippers to the jail. Inhumanity of our system is unbearable. And at the speed at which things are worsening, I shudder to think what future awaits us. [Source](https://twitter.com/pencilashan/status/1332008035796054016)  At one hand we have Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw who treated Pakistani POWs of 1971 war with utmost respect and dignity. And on the other hand we have current Regime who is violating human rights brazenly. Meanwhile warden, "" subah utho, kasrat Karo, Naha lo, ye Parkinson sab thik ho jyega"".
But seriously though why tf aren't they giving him straw? Are they thinking he'll break out of the prison with that... RIP constitutional values of India...the soul of India is dead But that shit spitter gets bail in no time.

How do people still expect others to trust in justice system? Court should just let him go based on that the jail does not have conditions for humane housing of prisoners. And he's a religious priest mind you, that just stood up for the rights of native tribals. As someone who has seen a close one suffer and die from Parkinsons… my heart shudders when I read about Stan Swamy! Pure evil. Modi has done so fucked things with this country he has ran economy into the ground I don't know how are we letting this happen What are you talking about? You AuntyNationals. Our justice system is the best. Didn't you saw how Pornab got quick justice? I feel this is a torture, and a message to others that if you don't bow your head  before us, this is the condition you will face. He has not been proved guilty. He is a human being with some health issues, can't a Jail authority take a decision to provide some basic things. 
We should work on building and empower all kinds of institutions rather than politicians using it. A far relative of mine died from Parkinsons. I met him just once before he passed away. I saw him struggle to just chew food. The image of him trying to simply breathe and eat at the same time broke my heart. It was just a glimpse as, at this stage he didn't like people seeing him. The stone-cold cruelty one has to have to see someone struggling from this disease and to deny them basic dignity is unimaginable. Whatever the case may be, this simply something that I will never forget about this government and their cruel influence on our justice system. NIA just told the court that they don't have a straw and a sipper to give it to him.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/do-not-have-a-straw-and-sipper-to-give-stan-swamy-nia-tells-court/article33185647.ece I understood the true degree of social engineering of minds in India after one of my naive colleague started putting status supporting Arnab Goswami. I just told him to not to get carried away by the media narrative. Free Father Swamy, the oldest man accused of terrorism in India! All he did was fight for the poor. Fuck the draconian system and government Your Lordship, I wrote you but still ain't callin'

This is Stan Even kasab was given basic human rights for 1&1/2 years! NIA literally got away with telling the court it has no ~~fucks~~ straws to give. On the very day Chandrachud was pontificating about citizens rights to justify special treatment he meted out to doorknob. Stan Swamy ain’t the puppet arnab goo-swami! India is becoming a cursed country We'll never see all those centrists talking about about rights here or the bhim Koregaon case or for Sanjeev Bhatt. They were coming to out of the woodwork for arnab, they were even here not just making comments making top posts with lot of support. India has always been cruel to it's minorities, and people are proud of it ! Sad, hope he gets relief soon. Hope news reports this wider.

Just an observation, not justification.

 *  When the goverment has strong leadership, judiciary acts meek
 *  When the goverment has weak leadership, judiciary acts smart

Judiciary and goverment leadership are also humans, laws of power and ego applies.

Now we have strong leadership... So judiciary goes meek and dance to the set tune.

If this news gets attention, the outcome maybe better. Justice is not blind, guess justice reads news and reddit comments.

Indian citizens, judiciary and other institutions are not yet used to democracy, still a lot hierarchical. I hope the situation improves with people satiring and critiquing. We can all learn to have a bit of irreverence to authority and power. He should change his name to Arnab Goswami and will immediately get a sipper according to CJI. I'm crying for real. Is he actually proved to be guilty? Our judiciary systems were always archaic but now they’ve started to become inhuman as well. Naughty boy! LOL Laws are formulated for human beings yrr, and people are not human, how can you even expect that they'll show a bit of human common sense, if that's a word."
Protester at Sydney Cricket Ground during the Australia-India ODI,,Business/Finance," Whats Adani doing in Australia?. i saw some posts about this?.Can anyone explain? This guy thinks indian public can put pressure on SBI😂😂. I have to wait for 3 hours to get a DD to pay my college fee from my account and pay fees for the DD which is handed to be reluctantly. If thanos came to sbi during lunchtime and demanded money or he will blow up the world, sbi employee will still not give a fuck. Wait for some more time, He would be a Bank by then. He don't need SBI Adani wants to build a coal mine in Australia. SBI is giving the loan to Adani.
Most Australians are against this mine.


Then why are they not protesting against their own govt., who sanctioned this project? Building coal mine in 2020 ?? Wtf, I thought we were going carbon free by 2050. That second picture has a great potential to become huge même. Why's a white guy protesting against this? What is the issue exactly?

For me personally, SBI has been amazing. Very fast and cooperative. (PS: I'm not from BIMARU region so maybe that is a factor) Please someone photoshop the placard to Warner's hands in the second picture. Adani loan? Lol they are approved by Australian govt to produce coal . Australian have to balance out the investment from China that's why plant is there in the first place. Warner in the background is like ""arre bc meri rozi roti ka sawal hai"" Australians don't know about SBI.

This guy is protesting the Government handing over almost 1 billion aud to Adani to build a coal mine.

Which is just a stupid idea on so many levels, but corruption. Even warner seems to be protesting as well.. How one billionaire could keep three countries hooked on coal for decades: Gautam Adani

My aunt wanted to enroll her kid into whitehatjr and I convinced her against it,"We all know how shitty that scam of a company is, but most parents aren’t aware of it yet.

I visited my aunt yesterday and her kid came to me and told that she is going to be an astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me, where have we all heard about this shit.

Upon further investigation with my aunt and sitting her down and explaining all the shit those people are doing, she was smart enough to get convinced and understand what a scam that company is.

I saved my aunt’s hard earned money and you all can do it too. Speak to your family/friends and make them aware of these shitty companies tricks, and make sure they do not fall for it.

Let’s together expose these scammers.

Edit: Thank you for your support and check r/WhiteHatSr for more info.",Business/Finance," Wow, oh wow!

Good job OP.

We need to discuss tactics and create content against White Hat Jr.

We have to create a mass movement! I have started making my family members aware of this scam a company. I barely participate in family whatsapp group discussions but I've made use of it to spread the word about this scam company. I have just emerged from under that rock. Can you briefly explain what this company is selling (I understand it’s something about coding), and why is it a scam. Please share how you convinced her Power users are real.

This is that guy who everyone calls when their friends and family, relatives need advice on which new phone, laptop, TV or digital tech to get.  
In other domains this may be that person who gets asked about which puja, vrat/fasting and all that nonsense is to be done. 

Meaning one might disagree with the validity of the activity but *Word of Mouth* works and it works to different degrees in different markets/societies.  
In a place like US the efficacy of it might be low but in India this thing has a higher value (for now), whatever it is in statistical terms. Give this man a cookie! Good job my dude. Wait till the aunt talks to her neighbours.

People are not enrolling their kids to these courses for the skills the kid may join, they are enrolling the kids for the bragging rights.

For the next party when the mother can introduce her ""little programmer"" to the family & friends. My friend got a job with those guys , what should I do? >astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me

LOL, hahahahahaha I have convinced over 10 ppl. . hell I even made them go for Udemy courses for Python .. WHJ is BS.. You were just jealous. That kid could have changed the world. If you want to succeed, you need whiteshat jr. I just saw a new ad with Hrithik Roshan Shut  up and take some karma Someone should compose a stinker of a Whatsapp forward we can spam to our family groups. Atleast there's one thing we can learn from the BJP IT Cell. It works. Well done.  Parents would go to any lengths to give their child a ""competitive"" edge over others. That's what whitehat jr's selling on. That is what coaching sells on too. It's not developing interest in coding, that's just a side benefit. If parents understand that comparison damages kids a lot, the nation would be doing a lot better. Making them understand that is difficult but you've done that. So, well done again. I am also 14 and I wanted to learn programming some time, my dad and mom were seeing all theses ads and wanted me to do whitehat, took the free class where they just taught me how to make a basic game and that too without any real programing lol. Anyways at that time i wasn't interested in all these kiddish games so I pulled out and I'm doing free online courses for python. Hi. Can we get school associations to write a notice citing their stance on these orgs? I can coordinate. Is there anything the gullible parents who thought Wolf Gupta and Ryan Venkat are really working for Google and they landed crores in salary do? Can they launch a class action law suit against this company in India? 

If they did this the US, they would have been in a deep trouble already. damn! Good job! Can someone explain this WhitehatJr stuff?? Seeing a lot of it lately and don't really know what's going on. Pls help. Thanks for saving a soul. You are on a mission, Don't stop :) Send her to the youtube channel of ""Sentdex"". He has hundreds of videos of Python and he starts from the very basics. 

If your cousin doesn't understand anything, tell her to try again in a decade. Same here even my cousin brother wanted to learn coding so my aunt decided to join him in Byju's but I convinced them not to Thanks to you she is convinced ....
These shit heads should stop knowing so much resistance is happening. Thanks to the guy fighting against them. Plus thanks for being a light of hope too. Lol their coding is drag and drop blocks when asked when hard code would be taught they said later no joke they said later anyway after fighting with my parents my sister is no longer doing that LOL, if her kid doesn't turn out to be the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezoz, then she's gonna blame you for the rest of her life.

Just Indian mom things. I have found the most popular way to convince people, It's free. You don't have to pay for something that's available on the internet. Not much argument is made after that. What happened to our indian parents?  How did their obsession change from doctor/engineer to computer programmer/app developer. Is this the new obsession of the new  millennial parents. 🤦‍♂️ Somewhere around 9-11 months ago, one of my distant relatives called me to check whether he should enrol his kid. That was the first time I heard about WHJ and after listening to the concept I got a feeling that this was less related to any genuine learning experience for a kid but more related emptying pockets of anxious parents. To the best of my judgement I requested him to stay away from this and rather let the kid spend some time playing physically instead. 

Props to the parent who sought advice from someone in academia/ related field. Most others don't. So it's upto us to proactively inform them. Well done, OP! Programming is an intellectual exercises.

Teaching syntax is trivial. You can help her by asking to buy ""Raspberry Pi"" and it will cost only 5000-7000 , to have a open source computer where kid can not only learn programming but also physical computing and that too free, the"" Magpi"" magazine teaches   tutorials and that too with free digital version. That's nice, at the same time, I would recommend an alternate source to your niece to learn programming from as well. 

False advertisement and censoring criticism are not entirely new and most companies do it at least to some degree. A company tends to do it in its initial stage than later. Remember how you exaggerated some of your skills and achievements on your CV the first time you applied for a job? I get the hate for whitehatjr but I would really like to know how good their programming courses are, from an objective perspective. I know a kid called Chintu, he's enrolled with white hat jr he's pretty smart I'd say. good job !! The way it is going on, I think Karan Bajaj’s gonna end up like Nirav Modi Good job OP.

Recently my Didi’s kids and other cousins asked me about it. I said no and shared them “real” sites like khanacademy, coursera and more. 

Even bought some paid iPad apps for them. They are loving it. 

And no distractions with ads or scammers calling them with discounts. Let's do it let's make a petition to ban white hat jr.  guys what do you say? good job Congratulations! Noice 
You saved a life to be honest U did a great job bud. Salute All hero's don't wear capes. Thanks for this man. astronaut programmer, WTF!! Good job! This bloody WhatsApp , in every week , I have to break several myths of those god damn Nuskhe .. like recently, there’s a message claiming to be cure of Cronavirus by just doing steam bath .. don’t know why , people search on Google .. read some news to get gist of it . Great job man.

I think you should add the points/arguments that you used to convince her in the post above so that we can have an example. I am curious about how people are willing to pay that much amount ? I feel sad for my friend who was hired by this scampany, he had no other choice , as he had lot of financial problems. Way to go OP!!! Good one! Need more people like you I'm proud of you Thank fucking God! Good Not all heroes wear capes Good job boiiiii 🙌 Hope there is an alternative learning method you could recommend the kid though?

IMO her dream > taking down some construction of capitalism that's just another hydra head at the end of the day. Massive respect Ek ko to bacha liya, par iss desh me ""stubborn parents in a rat race with the society"" ki koi kami nai hai dude.

Apne logon ko bacha lo bas.

Byjus aur white hat aur alag alag chutiyappe aate rahenge aur prosper krte rhenge.

Bhai IIT ke naam pe maa baap apna ghar bech dete hain, dimag to ghutno me rehta hai unka. Wtf is an astronaut programmer? This is the reason it is said “Not all hero’s wear capes” Is byju also in the same category as whitehat? Can someone explain what the controversy is behind WhiteHat Jr? This is the way More power to you! That's nice of you to do that Well done, Op. My aunt was going to enroll my cousin too. I convinced her against it and thankfully, my tweets had already made an impression in her mind that there was something wrong with the company. I convinced her to let me teach my cousin and so far, it's going great. 😁 Embrace yourself op .....

A defamation case coming right up for you lol Good job OP. For everyone intrested check out r/whiteHatSr  
You'll find everything you need to convince someone Why is r/India suddenly ganging up on whitehatjr? This is the third or fourth post with 2000+ upvotes and hundred+ comments 

I have nothing for or against whitehatjr, but just wondering. The scam lies only in the false/exaggerated advertisements right? What they've done to suppress bad reviews is highly unethical and I would like to believe it's illegal too but does that make it a scam?  At the end of the day they do provide coding classes in exchange for money so only their ""promises"" are false.   
  
That being said there's probably tonnes of better resources out there for kids to learn (if they want to) so this company shouldnt exist in the first place. What is astronaut programmer Nice job OOTL

What's Whitehat Jr.?

EDIT: An online computer tutorial? Why is it a scam. Kids should know how to code if they want to learn. Get a lawyer OP. W. Excellent. I passed on a few links shared by Pradeep with my school group. Stopped two of my friends from registering their kids. Pradeep is doing God's work!  I did that as well like two months ago... My aunt was keen on making get kid join WhiteHatJr and Byjus. Granted they have fuck all money, I still convinced them to not join the course What WhiteHatJr did is called topee pahanana (to make a fool of someone)! Their whole marketing / sales / approach to coding is terrible. Yet, I have both my daughters enrolled in their course. They enjoy themselves, they like the teachers and have a lot of fun coding. 
Weird situation I know - but I do think that they have created a decent idea but then bludgeoned it with this whole hype of being the next tech founder rather than just keep it simple - kids enjoy activities and keep it at that level.

Edit: For what it's worth - I also find their classes very reasonably priced. Why exactly is it a bad company? I am a student of whitehat jr. in age of 14 inaware of the shits of this company and i can confirmed it actual taught me to code. My parents didnt buy any tech or any special courses etc so we basicaly dodged all that shit. so apart the scams im telling you this course is actually helpful to me and will probably help your child. just avoid any extra purchasing"
Trenches dug upto several feet on national Highway to stop Farmers going to delhi. This is Indian government against peaceful protests for you.,,Policy/Economy," Like Ravish Kumar said, ""they have erased the difference between covid19 and farmers"" (same trenches were dug during the lockdown to curb covid19) [removed] So govt is vandalizing govt property They have come prepared..they are in huge numbers. Will fill it back in no time. they are farmers! Shameful Am still amazed people cant see what government is doing and still voting them in power!!! Its absolutely fucking bonkers... and these roads will never be made properly... SMH it took government 50 years to probably build these roads and this government is destroying the property..... Anpahd  jhahil chutiya nandan modi hai toh sab mumkim hai. ""National Highway""?? This is crazy Can I have the source please? Source ? Fuck Modi government and fuck everyone who support him. Fuck every main news paper and channel not showing the ground reality of farmers marching toward Delhi. If this was a true democracy, farmers have every right to protest in New Delhi. Modi thought Punjab was Bihar or UP, we are born different. Don't fuck with Punjab or the farmers. This will be the end of Modi era. i don't get it though. If you are in power and you choose not to listen to people, then why are you in power? Cowards are doing all this to avoid gatherings and protests in Delhi. International news will pick it up and hamper the supreme loser's fucking image no.. Every word of gormint aunty is golden. Reread the whole thing she said. 

But remember she was talking about Pakistan, not about Indian Govt. The fellow who has the stick owns the buffalo.

We do not deserve good roads. So someone dug them up, to keep someone's pride intact. He may not have said them to do it, but they did it anyway. If you are in power and you can't respect farmers what can you do. BJP is tripping on power so hard. They just can not see us criticising the government For those who are asking for source

Small price to pay for being in khatra /s aight is there a neutral candidate this coming election?  We have a Donald Trump and Joe Biden case over here. Unpopular opinion: I think the government is probably doing the right thing here.

The reason I say so is that these protest have a very high probability of turning violent (bus burning and similar stuff). If that ends up happening we will still blame the government of not taking enough action even when they were aware of the possibility.

The government is in a tight spot here and erring on the side of caution seems to be the correct approach. India has always been authoritarian, and will always remain authoritarian. Are constitution makers couldn't even wait for first election to make constitution useless.

Any way the only people who will ever protest for less market freedom are communists and unions(foot soldiers of communists). [removed]"
The BJP is making Rohingyas an issue in Hyderabad Municipal Elections,"While it is true that few Rohingyas do live in a few refugee camps in the city, why are refugees of a particular community being targeted? BJP seemed very concerned about refugees, wanting to bring in the CAA to help them, but show their hypocrisy when the refugees are Rohingyas. Of course, they're not citizens, can't vote or get any benefits, they're here just for safety till things get better in their home country, but you still want to drive them out because they're not of the religion you like? What do the pro CAA people have to say regarding this?",Politics," BJP's presence isn't good for a place like Hyderabad. They're the easiest target. No one to stand up for them. Muslims. Easy to brand anyone opposing BJP tactics as anti national. Floods, garbage, rampant corruption in road contracts all are irrelevant. 
Only rohingya relevant. And yet they might win. Says a lot about the intellect of the average voter in India BJP knows how to pander to their audience. CAA is not about helping refugees. It's about bringing in more Hindus and putting the Muslims in detention camps.

The clearest evidence of this is that the govt calls the Pakistani ahmadiyya a persecuted minority and yet refuses them the benefits of CAA."

Ah, not that kind of party. Never mind. It's already a one party state >So the court’s ruling was not surprising. What shocked was the speed of its intervention. Mr Goswami spent just a week in detention, and his case had hardly reached the lowest rung of courts, yet the country’s topmost judges ignored the court’s backlog of some 60,000 cases to schedule a bail hearing within a day of the anchor’s appeal. This is in a country where prisons hold twice as many inmates awaiting trial, some 330,000 people, as they do convicts.

>A majority of these “undertrials” come from minority groups and a quarter have spent more than a year behind bars, reckons Leah Verghese, a law researcher.

This is truly fucked up. The ""fair"" judicial system is one of the most unequal things in this country.  The Supreme Court recently granted bail to journalist Arnab Goswami, who was arrested in November last year for his alleged debt to a decorator who had left a suicide note blaming him, among others, for his fatal distress. ""If we as a constitutional court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?"" a judge said.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=ee135a)* Did anyone see Rahul Gandhi anywhere? More than Modi, I’m starting to hate RaGa even more. This “silver spoon” boy doesn’t do what’s required from an opposition, then he’ll jump into elections without required grass work only to weaken the regional opposition party in various states. First past the post is a very unrepresentative system. It tends towards a two party power structure (UK, Canada, Australia, USA)

Once you add in regional parties (based off of language, tradition, religion) you end up with seats taken away (eg. SNP in Scotland, Quebecois parties in Canada, in India it's dozens - AITC, DMK, AIMIM) 

This allows a ruling party to dominate the seats with low low voting percentage, eg. India 37% of the vote, 56% of the seats, UK 43% of the vote, 56% of the seats. 

With no effective opposition (INC look pretty ineffective from my viewpoint) the BJP may well grow stronger with marginal or even very little gains in percentage vote increases. 

India isn't a one party state, but the BJP can act like it with this voting system as they dominate a fractured parliament, with regional opposition (with their own goals) and an ineffective national opposition."

> The hospital administration has accepted that there was a stray dog menace inside the hospital and that they had informed the local civic authorities no action was taken.

> &quot;The body was handed over to the family after formalities. They didn&#039;t want an autopsy and were taking it away. They might have left the body unattended for a minute when the incident happened,&quot; Chief medical superintendent of the district hospital, Dr Sushil Verma said.

Be patriotic.,"""A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.""

When they ask whether you support BJP or you are anti-national, tell them you are a patriot.",Politics," *""The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility, but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war.""*  - **Sydney J. Harris**

*""All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.""*  - **Adolf Hitler** Do you think BJP supports have mind to understand logic and reasoning they are brainwashed beyond repair. Its a sad reality that one has to prove his allegiance to his country just because he has a different political view. BJP has successfully equated patriotism and nationalism to a single party like in China for many people.

If someone is asking you this question, call out their fallacy. Its clear false dilemma. You don't have to assert your patriotism or nationalism or humanity to satify insecurity of others."
"Sex workers in #Maharashtra will be given financial aid of Rs 5,000 per month from Oct to Dec. Those sex workers who have school-going children will be provided additional Rs 2,500. Nearly 31,000 beneficiaries have been identified: State Women & Child Development Ministry. (ANI)",,Policy/Economy," Good initiative. If govt recognizes this work (industry really), then they should legalize it with right kind of paperwork, taxation and STD testing standards. Obviously most get into selling body business by force and not by will. Legal framework for sex trade will only help make more legit when it comes to trades. Progressive AF although I wish the aid was a bit more. Great step towards a fairer world. Damn good. Morality and other social perceptions notwithstanding, I think it is about time people in this industry are treated like humans. Given the history of Indian scams, hope its not politicians wives the target of such financial aids. I hope the money stays with the sex workers, and this entire exercise doesn’t end up as a gofundme for pimps. 31,000 number is far from reality. These numbers may be from urban centres like Mumbai and Pune. But it is good initiative, baby steps but positive. good on the government. If they could just make their working conditions better it would really help them like easy reporting of violence, continuous testing. I think many are still forced into this so the long term solution as always is a good education system and accessibility to all. I hope that the actual people are really benefited by that That's such a good step forward. Somedays this reddit and our country is filled with horrible news but this is really nice to hear, I hope these women definitely get these benefits not just on paper but in real life and that other states follow suit as well.

The BIS typically processes imports within 15 days, but the paperwork is now taking up to two months to complete.

&nbsp;

>**Banks that had lent to your competitor telcos were forced to incur massive losses on their loans. Since most of the affected banks were nationalised ones, the hit ultimately has to be borne by the taxpayer.**

Farmers march: Thousands headed to Delhi today amid heavy police deployment,,Politics," Modi doubled their incomes, so they going to Delhi to collect their monies?

Divide and rule, that is what RSS/BJP knows. This country has so many victims,and they still cannot seem to get under one roof. - Police said they will not allow the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws to enter Delhi if they reach the borders of the national capital.

- Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who visited the bordering areas, said “Due to Covid-19 guidelines have been issued in which political gathering is not permitted here and for this, their (the farmers’) request was rejected. If they still make an attempt, we have deployed personnel at the borders to not let them enter the national capital. We are also in contact with Punjab and Haryana Police.”

- Traffic movement is likely to be disrupted in the border areas. The traffic was also closed from Bahadurgarh towards Delhi on Thursday evening, officials said.

- Delhi Metro services from neighbouring cities to the national capital will remain suspended on Friday in view of the ‘’Delhi chalo’’ protest march. However, metro services will be available from Delhi towards the NCR sections.

- Five sand-laden trucks and three water cannons have also been stationed at the Singhu Border to stop tractors being driven by the protesters, news agency PTI reported. Officials have stated that drones have been deployed to keep a tight vigil to maintain law and order.

- Areas affected by the police deployment include - NH-24, DND, Chilla Border, Tigri border, Bahadurgarh border, Faridabad border, Kalindi Kunj border and Singhu border.

- Authorities in Haryana have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of the protesters.

- Reports of altercation surfaced from Ambala on Thursday where barricades erected by the police on an overbridge on the Ghaggar river were thrown into the river by the farmers after facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. The police, on loudspeaker, asked farmers on the Punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. As smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter Haryana around noon.

- In political development, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who criticised the Haryana Police’s action.

- Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab’s 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted.

Kissing scene in a temple- Insult to Hindutva, love jihad

not surprised, really I hate this.

What's happening to our country?

Why are these people being so weird? Good.. Remove these romance and sex from movies and series and bring back the old fashioned dance scenes! Keep some of our idiotic traditions alive and kill anything different! 

""One step forward and two step back"" should be an Indian National motto. Is this the temple kissing thingy from a series that’s gaining traction lately ? If so, I’m waiting when they’ll abolish the following temple for their sexual sculptures:

Khajuraho Temples Madhya Pradesh, 
Sun Temple: Konark, Orissa,
Virupaksha Temple Hampi, Karnataka,
Jain Temple  Ranakpur Rajasthan, 
Sun Temple, Modhera Gujarat, 
Sathyamurthi Perumal Temple Tamil Nadu,
Lingaraj Temple, Bhubaneshwar, Orissa Epic. 
This government only thrives on love jihad propaganda and hate. Forget about GDP just focus on dividing people instead. Worked for the British and working for RSS meanwhile marital rape is legal, priorites man, priorities Another distraction for the masses. 

Politics of polarisation is the worst. But from a politician point of view it has the highest effort to impact ratio. All this government does is pick up controversial issues for outrage so that actual problems that they have created don't come under citizens' purview. Ab kare to kare kya, 

bolein to bolein kya? Looks like the right is easily aroused. That makes them angry. I think that's funny. Especially the part where they all agree to be angry. Which means they are all aroused as a group. LOL. It’s a very nice show. Must watch. This is something I don't understand. If you have a problem with some content, don't fucking watch it. Why tf do these people have to create such a fuss about it? Same applies for any content across any medium.

India-destroying artistic freedom since 1947. #Source: [smishdesigns](https://mobile.twitter.com/smishdesigns/status/1331783626296475648) so what's the context? As someone who has not watched indian media in long time i have no idea, are they french kissing? I always thought Hinduisim was a liberal religion(or way of life as everyone says) when compared to the abrahamic religions which conveyed conservative ideologies. But these days bhakths are getting offended for anything and everything. Had the intimacy scene been in any ruin there would have been no opposition but the temple depicted there is alive with active devotees.

There are some institutions with sanctity and own rules like Schools, Research Labs, Business Centers and so on. You got to follow their rules. And temple too is one of them.

If kissing was to be done anywhere and everywhere, why do you want pubs, resorts, spas, beach and hotels then?

Depicting Khajuraho sculptures and giving excuse for scene is just like masturbating in front of teacher in whole class because there's a chapter in syllabus : ""Reproduction in Humans.""

Sex is a part of culture and not the culture as a whole. Sculptures meant keep aside your lust and enter the place with calm mind. We respect SEXUALITY and NOT LUST.

If you are so self-obsessed (because even minors visit temples) and cannot have self-control for a few minutes then the problem lies in you. I got notification for this and I want to ask why am I here? Seriously whatever with this fight over can anyone fill me up with this? Q. Stree / patni / premika  kya hoti hai?

They r just finding reasons to turn heads the other way lmao and they just got one more For those wondering about the context : This is from a series which is based on the book A suitable Boy - Vikram Seth. 

The novel follows the story of four families over a period of 18 months, and centres on Mrs. Mehra's efforts to arrange the marriage of her younger daughter, Lata, to a ""suitable boy"". Lata is a 19-year-old university student who refuses to be influenced by her domineering mother or opinionated brother. 
In the meantime Lata is approached several times by a boy her own age and after a few meetings feels she has already fallen in love with him. She learns his name is Kabir Durrani and is distressed when she realises he is Muslim as her Hindu family would never allow her to marry a Muslim man. When her early morning meetings with Kabir are discovered she tries to run away with Kabir, who refuses. Ultimately she gives up on kabir and marries a Hindu. 
So during one of their morning meets Kabir and Lata kiss each other in an old Fort once. People are offended coz this scene apparently promotes Love Jihad. Dare to show these type of scenes in mosques, I challenge! ᕙ (° ~͜ʖ~ °) ᕗ Masjid mein bhi kissing ,sex scene dikhao jahan ladka hindu ho or ladki muslim ,for dekhna foe kahan jayenge. What happened, can someone explain? Are bhakts making ruckus about it or have some scenes actually been deleted?

Edit: Not sure why somebody downvoted it. I genuinely want to understand what’s the situation. Time to get a VPN guys. This uproar made me see the movie ans recommend it to a bunch. Mira Nair is a great director. Bhakts come across more and more as having an inferiority complex to Muslim guys.

I’d wager they subconsciously think themselves as not equal or good enough and thus we have them triggered at stuff like this. [removed] I'm new to this. Can someone please explain what this post is all about? Can anyone explain this please I read this book when I was in college... in 1997. I guess bhakt brigade don't read books and only figured out this storyline now. Ye kya hai? ""The object of Section 295-A is to punish deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulating its religion or the religious beliefs.""

Section 295A needs to go else more ""religious people's feeling might hurt"" What is the name of the film Democracy is a slow process any young democracy has these issues I wanna know if the person who filed the complaint is a Netflix subscriber or not je suis Charlie Of course that's what our MPs are doing, there not much else that needs their attention. Scenes of nudity and sexual intercourse on the walls of Khajuraho - move on, nothing to see here.

"IIT-R professor calls student 'soft' for not attending class due to father's death, draws social media ire",,Non-Political," Few years ago a professor at one of the NIT drove a student to death. Why? Attendance shortage due to some shit in his family that the professor knew very well about. The guy quit and ended himself.

A student's life in India is so cheap... if that professor stays then he will try to make this student's college life hell. That's exactly a scene from 3 idiots and still a grim reality in many colleges I think it's fair to call the professor an asshole. Reminds of the time when I was a student at IISc and had lost my grandfather before a very important exam. My PhD advisors didn't offer a single word of condolence when I told them, never empathized with my mental state, and pretended as though these are just ""regular life events"" that one must get through. 

I tell you, sometimes people in academia do not show an ounce of humanity. They can be ruthless. Everyone sack that asshole professor. A lot of profs are  like that. Anything thry say goes,  and agar offend ho gaye,  to semester to bas gaya.  They may have been good academician,  but not all are not good teachers. India mein gand marate reho chahe kuch bhi ho jaye. Baap mar jaye, kisi ka accident ho jaye par gand marate raho. Daya khatam ho chuka hai. Work hard to get into IIT and then get called 'soft'.... What an insensitive comment to make, put yourself in other person's shoes and say what you say. And maybe the professor is actually mentally ""strong"" but he is wrong in assuming that everyone is like him.      
Anyway get some perspective prof, your subject isn't that important. Not more than a parent. Wtf > the teacher wrote a mail saying he never intended any wrong

yeah right, ~~he is only sorry because this blew up~~ his statement was more like an excuse.. > Professor Patit Kundu

First name checks out. Oh yeah, the professors in these so-called ""Institutes of national importance"" have this entitled holier than thou attitude and you can't even touch them since many of them don't have student councils too. I'll give an example from my college(not IIT but NIT), where there was a kid who got in using the disability quota and was a bit weak in his academics. One of the professors bullied him which finally resulted in the poor kid committing suicide late down the year. And nothing happened to the professor too and he's still the HOD. Fuck that asshole and fuck this asshole. The education system is in need of a severe overhaul, the professors in these govt. institutes have become these spoiled brats who use any excuse they can to make the lives of students hell. Last year I couldn't attend a lot of classes because of my father's death. Every other teacher understood the situation and increased my attendance so I could sit in their exam, but this one prof wouldn't. I have to give a re-exam this year for the subject. The worst part is that the subject was one of those easy ones that are not part of your core curriculum. Life inside IIT is good is the biggest lie my teachers told me. It gets so tiring between constant assignments, quizzes, project, project vivas, lab, lab vivas that the best part of my day these days is just sleeping. I am so tired😩 I am a  IIT Roorkee 4th year student. The sadest part of the whole student is that the professor responsible is unable to understand the true situation and show sympathy to the student. Here is the response e-mail send by the professor after the video going viral. [response of the professor](https://www.imgurupload.com/uploads/20201126/2a5ca2771f515a8d01954af262d3a48e6b1c8504.jpg) Having graduated from IITR, it is a horrible institute. I and my friends were made to take an exam from the hospital because I had chicken pox and other guys were undergoing a pain medication for kidney stones. Naturally I flunked. There are many many more horror stories but IITR is a gandiya institute. India's best and finest educational institutes they say. Soft professor worried about student attendance >His mail stated, ""Instead of doing all these (recording and making it viral through your friends), you could have simply mailed me after the class to apologize to Vedanta for not showing apathy

What does he think the word apathy means? I might be wrong, but I feel like the professor wouldn't have acted like this if the student was female. Because then, being soft with a parent's demise would've been ok? 

Men too can have mental health issues. Unfortunately, society doesn't see it that way. He should be sued for harassment and defamation. I was a student of this professor , he threatened me with not letting me write my exams and asked me to leave the class because I didn't attend a few previous classes because of a foot injury. It was early in the semester and I would have easily attended the required number of classes to give my exams. Disheartening to see that this is still a thing that's happening. I lost my father when I was 17, in Class 12th. One of my teachers called me ""overly emotional"" and said I was ""running away from my responsibilities"" when I refused to participate in a school competition. My professor told me to take as much time I need and to take care of my family. as a chemical engineer who graduated from IIT roorkee- slap a fine on this professor please BC I don't think with what I earn and my future prospects that I can ever go out of India to live there. But I promise I will be a really good open minded uncle and will marry a hot aunty who is understanding and  money will be our least matter of concern. I hope there are other good bunch of potential uncles out there who plan on staying in this country to make it atleast bearable. A friend of mine was doing her JRF in IIT Kharagpur. This professor made her life hell, she never received her stipend while she was there(her family is somehow making the ends meet). Finally she had to quit! And no one spoke against that professor, he is notorious for this in the entire department and does the same to whoever he feels like! I have heard countless such incidents of asshole profs in my college. Sucide, oppression case, racism, sexism everything. Profs literally speak whatever nonsense they want in front of students. And it's really sad students don't really complain against these profs. These profs should not be allowed anywhere near IITs and yet many of them hold substantial power in their department. Another simp trying to look macho IITs are extremely overrated retarded places. Avoid at all costs."

My grandfather and my democracy are of the same age by now.,"I had expected both (grandfather and democracy) to stand on solid ground by their seventies, but the majority of his bones crumble the minority of his body as he tries to take a step forward.

He asks me to read the newspaper that says thousand peoples killed in mob violence, authorities turn a blind eye. Last month he forgot to wish me

Just take loni- ghaziabad road and you should end up near ambala cantt ( use map) and even private buses are following the same route I drove from Delhi to Punjab last night. Reaching Sonepat was the most the most challenging part, taking about 5 hours which normally takes 1. The delhi haryana border on the hoghway was blocked and we had to circumvent it by taking an excessively long detour. Next up there were road blocks at Panipat and Karnal and we had to leave the highway and circumvent them using village roads. At the end a journey of 4 hours took us about 10. Talking to protesting farmers, we came to know there are more protesters coming in from punjab side so police might block some other sections as well. As for traffic, there was none. So would I recommend? No. Is is possible to travel? Yes, if you have your own car and willing to take detours. Go to saharanpur and then to Chandigarh. Good enough roads They just announced that delhi police will let farners protest peacefully...maybe now police will unblock roads. Man that would really suck. not attending your own wedding haha.

Why is my state always at the bottom for nice things and always among the top for things like poverty and unemployment :'( Can you do the same but district wise instead of states. That would be be a more accurate reflection of the disparity Bihar last in everything Just outside the city of Delhi, there is a Kasba (township) called Dhauj. It is in Haryana but Delhi is a stone throw away. Practically no internet there. JIO, Airtel, Vodaphone, nothing works. I am surprised about the high percentage in Himachal Pradesh. One would think the opposite considering its majorly hilly state. No surprise seeing Delhi with the highest...but WB and its neighbouring states seem very very underdeveloped. Also Punjab, Haryana and HP(I think) aren't that bad. we should consider the K-FON project in kerala, against this backdrop. Congress leaders has been against it. The project is expected to be completed end of this year, connecting all homes in Kerala Oh my god I think something like this should be at the district level, not state level. Access can vary greatly within the state. I’m from Punjab but came to America when I was 7 so I’m not knowledgeable in this topic but could someone explain what the reason is for the Punjab region to have higher percentage than neighboring states?

Experience with WhithatJR,"Just  talking  about my experience with them as someone who has taught coding  (web dev to be specific) to kids and adults.  So I decided to apply to  be  a teacher for fun, because it was lockdown and I wasn't doing much  also  since I have 6-7 years of teaching experience .  First off there  aren't any requirements to be a teacher except to have a broadband  connection (not wifi).  The introductory call was pretty boring and  disorganized. First we had to make an account on [code.org](https://code.org/).  Its a million dollar company and they can't invest in their own  curriculum and material. That's when I knew it was a joke and decided to  basically not even go through it.  The entire introductory call  consisted of dragging and dropping blocks. LOL.

When  I asked about their pay, the woman said you can make upto 30,000  rupees. This again was a red flag,  what did she mean ""you can..."". It's  either you do or you don't.

They  called me repeatedly and wanted me to attend other sessions. I blocked  their number because I never intended to work for exploiters.

Their  whole advertising nonsense is out into the light and I'm glad. I'm sick  of these money mongers exploiting people and basically making real  educators look bad.  Yes you can learn online free and you can even pay  someone to teach you. But their whole system is deceptive and based on  fooling people to GRAB as many paid users as they can and then RUN. Just  like OYO and other MLM schemes/companies AKA startups

This  summer, whitehat""joke"" wasn't the only company willing to exploit  teachers and parents. Because of my experience teaching online I  interviewed with many more companies ( German company wanting to expand  in China, a Canadian company, and one in the UK trying to start in  India) I did not intend on working for them because they weren't paying  teachers well (ofcourse..) and their whole system was based on getting  as many paying customers while overworking teachers.  One of them asked  me how to explain ""algorithm"" to a 8 year old. Which to me was very dumb  because at 8 they're learning basic scratch and their language  acquisition skills aren't developed enough to even spell algorithm.

BTW  Byjus uses adobe and that's all there is to their whiteboard  animations.  They're also very aggressive with marketing and don't  really treat employees well.

Throwaway account but real experiences. I am still teaching (free to under privileged students and a decent amount to those who can afford to pay).",Science/Technology," I went through the hiring process for Lido, which seems alarmingly similar to shitehatjr. Their offer was also peanuts as a base amount for 5 hours a day of demo classes + upto 80k a month in incentives if you get enough parents on board. Exploitation of desperate youngsters inexperienced in negotiation is clearly a key part of their business model Also OP as a prospective teacher with a similar philosophy id love to get in touch. Could use some advice setting up my tuitions. Dm me if youre up for a chat about this. Did they ask you to pay to start working for them? Like an MLM does? contact u/pooniahigh  .

I want to ask indians about the treatment of women in india and their opinions on it,"I was  a little afraid to post this because you guys are indians and might take offense to my post but I went ahead to post it because I want to hear your side. I am from singapore, we are very developed and women have almost equal rights as men. I say almost because societally and in some rules that still exist, we're not given equal respect or rights but this goes two ways- meaning the same is true for men too. Anyway, I come from a very traditional family who moved from india. And my entire life has been about me being objectified and treated like a property by them in the name of the Indian culture and traditions and threatened and physically abused if I don't comply.

They are christians and they still believe in dowry and arranged marriage (meaning during a marriage that is arranged by parents of both sides, the girl's family has to ""give"" a huge load of gold to the marriage and say ""hey, this is how much she's worth, take her and this is often a few $10,000"". They want the girl to do ALL the household chores. I remember days when my dad would end work earlier than my mom or be on leave and all he would do is lay on the couch or use his phone/ computer and not help out at all. Like why can't men help out too? No one likes doing it but it needs to be done! On the end, my mother wakes up at 5am daily to cook for the family while my dad gets up much much later. My mom is a community nurse and her job involves visiting patients from home to home and she is tired after work because she is getting old and traveling is tiring. Meanwhile, my dad works in a remote company with a chair to sit all day but he can choose to stand too. Considering all that, my dad does almost nothing at home and my mom exhausts herself 4x more than my dad. She thinks she is doing it for duty and he thinks he doesn't need to help because he is not obliged to.

I couldn't take all that was happening in my house anymore. Everytime I opened my mouth to say anything, my dad and brother would dismiss me and say my opinion is not valid, what they were really saying is I'm a girl and because of that I don't know anything, even though I did much better than my brother in school and I do read a lot and pursue knowledge a lot. Had they listened to me for example, they could have saved $8000 during home renovations. What triggered me to move out of my home was all that and forcing me to study and do things I do not want to and pressuring me to get an arranged marriage. I moved so I can study what I really want- web development and I have an internship now. 

Despite all that, my family still sees me as a failure and a disgrace. They don't care about my academic achievements or career. They even forced me to go to the cheapest university in the country and not let me go to a good university overseas (which i initially wanted). Meanwhile, they are paying as much as university would cost to my brother in polytechnic- it is an alternative path to study before university and an option that I never had. Little do they know, that their ""perfect"" son scammed them of $2000 by printing out a fake form pretending like it was from the school saying he has to go on a compulsory school trip to china for 1 month or he would lose out on credits and it would cost that much. It was a trip with his friends. He also smokes, drinks and does drugs- none of which I judge or condemn but I am mentioning because my parents would flip if they find out I did that. I cut him out of my life after he r*ped his gf (that was the final straw) and has no idea what consent is after he told me how he tried to kiss girls at the bar and they flinched and I told him he cant do that he needs consent and he dismissed me- we argued about it then I realised his view is as distorted and messed up as theirs and I would be better off without him

Today, I work and cook almost everyday- which to me is a huge thing and takes a lot of effort and energy. I know this because I went through a phase of depression where I was unable to do anything but I picked myself up again and I see that as an accomplishment now and progress towards my long term goals. I dont understand how traditional people like my parents and people who don't respect women like my brother can look down on women so much. If my brother was living alone, he would not be able to balance career with housekeeping and cooking as making time for friends (this last one I need to work on more), he would be spending more than me ordering food and not keeping the house tidy. They take us for granted and look down on us when we can do more than them and I dont mean this in a condescending or looking down on only all men way- ofc women like my mom encourage this kind of thinking as well- but rather we have different strengths and it is foolish to look down on women and suppress them when we can do so much. I'm not sure if I made sense here...what are your thoughts on this...what is this worshipping of men and treating women like less than men?",AskIndia," TL:DR

I think in general this has to do with the culture, which will take more time to evolve.

This is how they are labelling protests of the farmers in the media.,,Policy/Economy," This is not surprising at all. Even the cops are treating these protestors differently. 

Yogendra Yadav described a case in Haryana recently. Farmers were protesting against the recent Farm Bills. Someone from BJP decided to take out a tractor rally to in support of the bills. Both the groups came in front of each other on the road. The protestors were standing on the side of the road and showing black flags to this tractor rally. Unfortunately, one person sitting on the tractor suffered a heart attack during this. The entire thing was captured on video. The person was taken to the hospital and was proclaimed dead.

Remember that the people on tractors were supporters of the bills. It was a rally initiated by BJP. 

Next we know, the cops charged the farmers who were protesting on the side of the road with 'murder' and arrested 7 people.

This is crazy. They are trying to suppress all protest through whatever means they can. 

[Here is Yogendra Yadav talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifrpM89fYT8)

Edit: Grammar and removed a few redundant words. Indian media is an enemy of the people Tractor jihad. As a Punjabi, I'm not surprised. I am not. 

It's easy for the media to label all farmers as Khalistani militants but what they don't know is that the Punjabi's are seriously fed-up this time. 

As long we serve the Army and Government, we are considered as loyal but when we ask for our rights and respect from the government - we are simply labeled as terrorists. 

Not surprised, this has happened before with us . Wouldn't be surprised that this government would frame us as the ""enemy of the nation"" again.

P.S - To those who think these protests are funded by Congress or AAP, they are not. In fact, the same farmers are abusing Capt. Amarinder Singh for his ineptitude. I remember a farmer burning a dummy, which had pictures of both Modi and Captain pasted together.

Also, Rahul Gandhi came here to rally, but he couldn't even find enough farmers to support him, simply because the farmer unions didn't want him here. Same with the Akali Dal. No surprise that Rahul didn't come here again. At the same time, many BJP leaders in Punjab have resigned from their party.

These protests are not political and don't make it one. There are more than 1,50,000 farmers protesting. When you begin to think they cannot stoop any lower, They surprise you with their shamelessness. Jihadi , khalistani , missionary , urban naxals , anti nationals  

What else does BJP use to frame others ? how do these chomus even come up with this Do those media channels have any proofs ? If not then this is fake news. Start a Twitter campaign against them. If people are not speaking then these media channels will continue to spread fake news and earn TRP. This news channel shouldn’t consume anything produced by farmers then! my expectations for these people are low but holy fuck!!! and to think some people will actually eat this shit like a hot chocolate baffles my mind When Muslims protest, they’re jihadis. When Sikhs protest, they’re Khalistanis. When Christians protest, they’re tied to missionary activities. When liberal Hindus protest, they’re urban naxals who are traitors to the community. I say that everyone here get used to these terms, because they’re not going away for a while. Translation please Can’t anyone put a case on them? For spreading fake news? Why were you watching tv9 is the bigger question Disappointed but not surprised. I wonder how these reporters live with themselves, knowing that they are fully or at least in part complicit in crimes against their own countrymen. Jab jaat logo ne poora haryana jala diya tha tab to sarkar se jhaant na hua tha,ab tear gas ke gole fenk rahe hai aur protestors ko khalistaniyon ka naam dediya.

Now we know where that money comes from, probably govt giving them ad revenue and Amit Shahs useless kid getting them the IPL sponsorship. Our media is the biggest Anti National cabal out there. They will sell out their own mothers, let alone their countrymen if they are paid enough. Looking at you too Arnab Shitswami 💩 It's not even surprising at this point. These good for nothing entertainment channels always relate opposition to some bogus motives to turn the masses against them. God there are so many khatere to Hindus... thank god we have our lord and saviour Mudi ji.

I’m taking bets on what our next khatra would be!! Yesterday love jihad, today farm jihad , tommorow tractor Jihad  , then u r civil liberties, then they willl boycott farmer's then they eat shit everything will be happy by themselves facists I want you all to remember that same thing happened in 1982 too, when Akali Dal was going to Delhi to protest in front of Asian Games. Haryana Government of Bhajan Lal (Congress), humiliated, bullied and brutalized Sikhs. That was a major major turning point acknowledged among Sikh historians. Only difference is no media covered it accurately then, right now every thing is playing very minutely on social media channels even if MSM is not covering it appropriately. People in general and Sikhs can see through this charade. Where's Arnab when ~~you~~ they need him most? Hey! I genuinely don't get what the fuss is about on the Farmer's bill, I have absolutely no knowledge on this topic, the sources I know are all based and right-leaning. Could someone please explain in a civil manner without putting your emotions first (I could get that on media outlets) why this bill is bad

P.S. I'm not looking for an argument, and I am not a BJP supporter To fir ye Khalistan wale to achche log honge... Holy shit. This is what Chomsky was talking about in his book. Feel like we live in Nazi Germany Wow!! The title is cracking and ironical "" kyonki hamein desh ki PADI"". South Indian here...I haven't  learnt Hindi. Can anyone Translate this please? The playbook of every fascist mother fucker. We literally have the worst media in the world, like Trump calls his media the worst but they are not even close to how bad, like piece of shit our media is, if I see one of these Anchors(I live in Noida) I will be having a bit of talk with them, asking stuff like how do you sleep at night? This and CAA, Tablighi and Hathras from some of them saw shitty reporting Anyone find this surprising.

It's in these situations that true colours are revealed Smh Can someone provide a 101? Why only farmers from Punjab are protesting? Bengal, Kerala - where are their farmers? First of all Khalistan is sikh related and not pakistan related and it's not terrorist related it's justice related tbh these are the same guys that vote for this kind of politics. Take any f'ed up section, students, unemployed, women, most of them vote for this. take the latest example of Bihar. I've no hope left now that things will get better. [removed]"

I'm a woman in India, this isnt possible here.

Except for people like Zoya Akhtar or Farah Khan or Meghna Gulzar. But that's like saying Indira Gandhi made it to the top. They were very capable individuals who got these oppurtunities only because of their families. Their privilege protected them from discrimination of a society they never had to fight.

If there are 50% women in the country but everyone has to watch content from the POV and fantasy of men, it affects how the country looks at the other gender. Ultimately leading to unrealistic behavioural expectation and sexual harrassment too imo. 

And if you still prefer movies like Kabir Singh where in the very first scene the woman agrees to go out with a complete dickhead and stranger to some remote farm where he wants to tutor her?? Youre poop. Real life women dont do that. Stop watching these movies. Support and share the better and more realistic movies.

Soooo, if an experiment gone wrong in a city in China can make the world stop, what do you know, maybe you'd help reducing crimes against women by watching and sharing non poopy content.

Love these two shows. I absolutely admire these creators. But I am a bit angry with you for missing Amy Poehler for her Parks and Recreations in the mix. ^(/s)

&#x200B;

>I'm a woman in India, ***this isnt possible here.***

I kinda agree with you here, *but also not really.*

# Generally, movies where harassment is glorified

>If there are 50% women in the country but everyone has to watch the POV and fantasy of men, it effects how the country looks at the other gender. ultimately leading to sexual harrassment too imo.

Every industry is accustomed to a certain way of working. 

* Creators are accustomed to making such content, because that what people want to watch. 
* People are accustomed to watching such content, because that what creators are making.

It's an endless cycle. **The issue here is the feedback loop is flawed**. Investors are afraid to invest in an experiment, and as a result people never get to vote towards an alternative.

In this cycle some people because a lot wealthy, and powerful. 

And when you try to change anything in such a powerful industry, you are blocking money from some very wealthy and powerful individuals. 

We need smarter people to navigate through change, but one thing is for sure, *change is inevitable*.

&#x200B;

About a year ago I read this quote on some subreddit. And I think it's important to consider it while we move forward.

>*When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like opression.*

&#x200B;

The world of entertainment is moving to OTT and VOD. More platforms like SonyLiv, Hotstar etc., are going to surfacing in the coming years.

And besides increasing the reach for uncharted regions, OTT has one huge benefit. **Shorter Feedback loop**.

If you have ever seen analytics for youtube you'll know what I am talking about.

&#x200B;

Those smart people I talked about 4 lines ago, they need to learn about how the new world operates.

Here's a fun fact:

* previously, ""ticket bookings"" at theatres was mainly the only metric considered to declare a movie as a success. ^(They also considered 'how many people didn't get back to theatres after the interval' but I have no idea what I am saying on the topic of Theaters and how they function.)
* OTT is great for consumers because it gives the creators a deeper and richer insight.
* Say viewer does the following:
   * watched a movie for the first 10 minutes and close the browser,
   * Fast forward too much through the movie,
   * Switched to another movie midway on the same platform,
   * Went to another streaming platform after reading movie bio,
* All these signals as a negative impression on the movie.
* Basically, letting the creators and the investors know: **People didn't like what you made.**

People in theatres would sleep through the boring parts, but on OTT, consumers have low patience. They'll either forward or close it entirely. We as consumers have more options.

**Use these tools on your hand as your weapon, and let the creators know what type of content you want to watch.**

&#x200B;

Well, that's for OTT. What about other content released in theatres? You can still use the internet to signal your content.

* Downvote the trailer and title songs on youtube *(Remember Beyonce sharma jayegi?)*
* Write a blog post about it,
* downvote movie on Google Search result.
* Write your review on IMDB

Make your voice heard.

# Why Women Can't Make Movies

First of all, that not true. As you have listed out some really high-quality content made by creators who happened to be women. Let's Just call them creators and not female creators.

**I have a few uplifting facts/news for you**

\- **India has patriarchy past** and it's justified because it *worked* back then. With our newly gained freedom, we took 3 generations to realise we should be investing our money. India as a country is very young. (we are relatively new to independence compared to how long civilisation has flourished on this land)

Things are changing though, but it'll take time. India is a huge country with millions of people with 1000s of unique cultures.

\- **We live in a Digital Economy.** Our lives have changed in 2020. Covid-19 has accelerated digital adoption by at least 5 years. We have a long way to go, but all in good time.

*Now here's the thing about the digital economy,* ***it's permissionless.***

If you are a talented creator, all you need is a decent computer to edit and a camera to record. Heck, today even the phones are powerful enough to record high-quality content. Just create it and show it to the world.

Does the BJP government own the highways in any way?,"I see, how BJP led state Haryana has been trying its level best to stop the farmers from Punjab to march towards the capital.

Aren't the citizens of this country allowed to travel from a state to another?

If they haven't been involved in any violence, neither in any form - what are the reasons to stop them from marching towards Delhi? How the fuck does a state government owns the highway or state borders? 

The time ain't far when you all would see the Orwellian prediction from his book 1984 turn into the reality. You know what is happening in short?

I guess these are the reasons behind stopping the march.

Does India fall into the 3rd world countries?,"According to google the third world countries are one's who had a role in WW1 & WW2 and got defeated and left themselves in poverty but as we know India didn't had a great role in WWs but as the image of India the world has some Western countries do think it is the third world.

What do you think?",AskIndia," Its just NATO - Communist bloc and NAM respectively for 1st, 2nd and 3rd.

Now used in terms of development alone. The First/Second/Third world labels were coined during the Cold War and tbh, most political scientists don’t use them anymore bc they grossly oversimplify the differences and similarities between states.

Basically, the first world is made up of western capitalist countries (the USA side of the Cold War, if you will), and the second world is communist countries (aka the Soviet Bloc) and the third word is everyone else. So yes, India is in the third world, technically. 

However, it’s also an NIC and a rising power with a rapidly growing middle class that’s responsible for more and more of the global economy so referring to it as a third world country isn’t exactly useful to political scientists.

Nowadays, the third world is considered just any developing state, but once again, most political scientists prefer not to use this categorization because it treats every developing country the same when they are very much not.  

TL;DR yes but the “first vs second vs third world” system is an outdated remnant of the Cold War I don't get why WW has any influence now. Japan and Germany were defeated. France was demolished and humiliated by Nazis.
All these 3 countries are developed and wealthy now. We were not a sovereign nation during the world war.. Indian soldiers fought for Britain in WW2 .. Meaning of a term often changes with time. In today's world the 1st world means rich developed nations like USA, Canada, West European nations, Japan, Australia, New Zealand etc.

The 2nd world now means nations which are close to be a developed nation like China, East European nations, Russia, Turkey, Arab nations, Argentina, Taiwan, Malaysia, etc.

The 3rd world nations are poor nations with low HDI  and widespread poverty like most African nations or South Asian countries. The word origin does not hold meaning anymore. There is no rigid definition. It changes over time.

In present context third word countries are developing countries with low human development, extensive poverty, high population, high income inequalities etc.

According to the present context, India perfectly falls into third world countries. first,second, third world countries are terms used during cold war so the countries who supported capitalism(USA) are first world, the countries supporting communalism (USSR) are second world and the rest neutral are third world countries. It's a vague term overall. From a political perspective, the countries that didn't side or didn't align upfront with either NATO or the  Warsaw Pact, are considered third world countries. India qualifies as a third world country here.

Now the term is(from what I have seen) used for countries that have a sizable population living in poverty and overall lack of infrastructure, basically underdeveloped(Likes of Somalia, Laos). But here, there's' no clear definition of the first and the second world.

The term is vague as I said before and its usage is entirely context dependant. This concept came during cold war, not during world wars. US and its allies were considered as the first world. Soviets and its allies were considered as the second world. All the other countries were considered as the third world. > India didn't had a great role in WWs  

Well the British empire had used around 1.5 million soldiers from the Indian army in the first world war,  and around 2.5 million in the second. Quite significant I would say... It's just that twe didn't learn about it in history, and the british considered Indian army as disposable toy soldiers.."
Indian wedding 'rules' can go fuck themselves,"Context: Brother got married yesterday (by choice) with full religious rites (against his choice). They have also officially registered the wedding. This is a love marriage in a metropolitan city. 

Our marriage rituals go from quirky old to inhumanely archaic. 
The entire host of touching object X to object Y while muttering words no one understands rule. The wake up at ungodly hour and fast for the rest of the day rule. The young person cannot pay respects to ancestors, but enfeebled, arthritic father can rule. The bride breaking earthen disks to signify breaking 'her seal' rule. The aunts who need to know if they previously ""had an affair"". Oh, and every other rule which I don't know because we're 'progressive'. 

But the straw that breaks the camels back:
They (both 30+) cannot share a room tonight for reasons which I (25+) ""cannot understand"".

Ignorance and arrogance is what wrong with people of indian subcontinent I'm out of the loop here but what are the reasons for not allowing to share room. Could be a stretch, but would it be possible for you to inquire from perhaps an cool old lady or dude, to whom no one listens, but is actually ahead of his time in thinking. I mean, I can only hope there might be atleast one of them, who would be open to satisfy a young one's curiousity such as yourselves. Try it out. Without a judgement and with an open mind that perhaps all oldies in your family or friends would be retards. With the emphasis on the word ""open mind"".

Even I am curious about the earthen disks and not sharing the room thing? Could you tell what state/community are you talking about? Now I am so confused. I am an Indian, Hindu. Most of the stuff that you mentioned isn’t practiced in my community!! cool

but you are not giving your elders the credit* they deserve- they atleast allowed the couple to go ahead with a love marriage. That's something I'm not allowed to have. The chanting and proceedings are fine (other than breaking the seal stuff) but who asks if you have slept with someone before I be fucking  tf do you care Hey any pond in mind think I might just join you there 🤪 Or you know be an adult and put your foot down. 

If you cant find the courage to speak up to your parents, you should not be getting married. Don't disrespect the culture. That is not allowed by Indian culture... I guess it's wasier to say this when you're priveleged but you really need to stand up to your folks if you want to being about these changes. Brother had a 5 minute non-religious wedding presided over by my father's professors from graduate school. Not as quick as some mallu weddings but got over with minimum fuss If you can't handle it then ignore it. What else can you do? A wedding is a special occasion for the entire family.

Confirmatory tests are only done in govt recognised lab and centres. She must have already undergone pretest counselling.

Being HIV positive does not mean one is suffering from AIDS. Medication must have already been started as post- exposure prophylaxis.
Symptoms related to HIV are not apparent even after 2/3 years of getting infected. Initial symptoms can be as vague as weakness or fatiguability to frequent infections like flu/TB because of lowered immune response.

Unless she is symptomatic to the extent of being deemed unfit to travel ( unlikely), there shouldn’t be any reason to restrict air travel.
Yes, she is high risk for covid and air travel can be risky. 

There are no travel restrictions or mandatory HIV testing for people traveling to India. You will have to check with the country she will be travelling back to. > I know it's strict entering the country if you have a diagnosis of HIV they don't allow you to enter.

That sounds extreme. Why would they have a law like that? There are no laws about HIV positive people entering or leaving India. I don't know of any country that does either. It's not like COVID where you can infect others just by breathing.

She should figure out where she wants to be treated, India or her home country. Her health and safety should be first priority - she should talk to a doctor first. Literally the first thing that comes up when you Google.

India doesn't have any health related rules especially for HIV + tourists. Only highly communicable diseases such as Yellow fever, polio, etc are given scrutiny. But people can get discriminatory so ask her not to disclose it with non medical professional and non sex partners.  

Even with no protection, the chances for HIV transmission from a positive person to the recipient person in vaginal intercourse is well below 1%. It will be a good idea to get tested again. Who was the guy she had sex with and why?"
How a young farmer from Ambala Navdeep Singh braved police lathis to climb and turn off the water cannon tap and jump back on to a tractor trolley,,Politics," He is the hero we deserve. If commandos are withdrawn for fodi, tadipar and pisht, they will become sissy boy in no time, harassing farmers will cost them kursi. UDTA PUNJAB  A video showing a farmer Navdeep Singh jumping on top of a water cannon-mounted vehicle and turning the tap off, helping several protesting farmers who were being targeted by it, has gone viral on social media. ""I climbed from a tractor trolley on to the truck and reached the tap. I turned it off, but a policeman had also climbed...chasing me,"" Navdeep said.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=d71f0a)* On seeing this I really wish India had a similar arms act as that of USA, whenever they make a law, the public can do nothing except protesting peacefully according to their terms, however the govt can use the power of military, police, army or any resource which is paid by taxpayers. They don't even listen to people unless you make trouble for them like stopping highways, railway tracks, and when you do that you have to face water cannons, tear gas. 

If our people were armed, the govt couldn't do shit without people's consent. And the current arms law is a version of imperial idea of disarming people to rob them the ability to fight back. They go on to say that allowing people to bear arms mean that state has failed to provide safety to them, but this is what actually is happening."

Midnight Detention Of Over 100 Farmers: Punjab & Haryana High Court Issues Notice To Haryana Govt.

https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/midnight-detention-of-over-100-farmers-punjab-haryana-high-court-issues-notice-to-haryana-govt-166401 godi media treating this as a khalistani movement... BJP in 2013 : Protesting is our democratic right, govt. must be held accountable.
BJP in 2020 : haha water cannon goes brrr.. farमर Ye naya Bharat hai. Ye apne annadaata ko bhool chuka hai. RSS goons will pretend to be farmers and derail the agitation by engaging in violence. Be careful about those turds. I genuinely don't understand how people have become so numb to this, though. 

I blame the media and the way it's shaped our discourse to become so bloody toxic. The way it labels the opponents of the government. The way those labels are then used to dehumanise or delegitimize their opponents making any kind of violence against them justifiable. 

For farmers, the label is 'misguided'. The minute they cast that label on them, it removes the need to negotiate with them because the label has created this idea that farmers don't have the requisite intellectual capacity to form their own ideas and so are easily led astray. If they no longer need to speak to them, they no longer need to consider their pleas. So, water cannons are now fair game. 

So bloody insidious. So bloody effective. Incredibly sad, though. Protesting is constitutional right they should be ashamed to stop em , blasting water in winter such a shame , the country which says ""jai jawan jai kisan"" enacting this shit laws means they will never care about ppl they care about mega corps , they have been protesting against em for month's no wide spread covarage being done by majority of the news/media , they played games before just to get into power (& propaganda)  now they will not go away because ppl are believing in their shitty stuff , the economy estimate to shrink 10%(IMF) , hundreds of millions are unemployed , botched pandemic response , no vaccination strategy & didn't procured like most countries did like 2× to 6× than their intended population+ booster shot , talks with Chinese but bj0 claims no one came into indian territory (1100sqkm gone ) , a normal  person will not get vaccinated before 2022 for sure , democracy rankings 27 to 51 (yr '14 to '20) , 94/107  hunger index , , ,20k crore package no where to see(average resident) ,  if still ppl are supporting facists/Nazis , the infamous love jihad no legal basis (under indian constitution)  &  use of uapa sedition for journalist and activists , rampaged propaganda fake news , bought news , many human rights organisations are leaving , ohhh they go about religion  on and on creating division between ppl , I can rant but I don't wanna so stop supporting em dumb morons Sabkha vishwas indeed Look at this, Sanghis are pretending to be farmers and pelting stones in front of camera.

This is all done to justify the brutality of the police and govt.

So I found out why they are asking for compulsory MSP. 

Under MSP farmers get Rs1864 /100 kg for paddy, which is almost Rs 20/ kg. I buy  a 50 kg Rice sack for Rs 2000 in Bengal, which is Rs 40/kg . Which is quite reasonable. 

Without MSP farmers get Rs 2 -10 / kg for onions and sold for Rs 85 -95 /kg in market. Which is way higher, the farmers gets almost nothing

"As internet restrictions in J&K cross 480 days, we await SC judgement #KeepUsOnline","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4xvlfhpflj161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a13b3e94f580535de686289ea4d703a62d6708

### Tl;dr

Today i.e. 26 November 2020, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying internet restrictions in the region which have already crossed 480 days. After successive rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court, 4G mobile internet access was restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu & Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but there has been no further relaxation of restrictions since then. Meanwhile, non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee remains a problem in Jammu & Kashmir which must be decided by the Supreme Court to ensure independent application of mind by these bodies and implementation of their recommendations.

### Background

Today, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying the internet restrictions imposed in the region. All communication services were first snapped on 05 August 2019, and so far, 4G mobile internet access has only been restored in 2 districts of Jammu & Kashmir, which are Ganderbal and Udhampur. In the remaining 18 districts, mobile internet speed is still being slowed down to 2G which is insufficient to support most modern websites and applications.  Due to slow internet speed, the residents of Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access online education, telemedicine and work from home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voyijbpllj161.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb84bbdb1a2d5212fa8db784e660db1e00fa5a64

The internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir have been the subject of successive rounds of litigation, with the most recent being the contempt petition and application for directions filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) earlier this year. On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court had [**constituted**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-courts-j-k-4g-restoration-decision-disappointing-but-we-are-determined/) a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,  (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu & Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. Since there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to [**file**](https://internetfreedom.in/fmp-contempt-petition-reply/) a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020.

During the course of hearings in the contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had held two meetings since its constitution on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020, and it had decided to defer the issue for two months since the security situation was allegedly not conducive to relaxation of internet restrictions. On 11 August 2020, the government stated that the Special Committee held its third meeting on 10 August 2020 where it found that the threat perception in Jammu & Kashmir continues to be high and that internet speed restrictions did not have any impact on COVID-19 control measures, education or business. However, the Special Committee [**agreed**](https://internetfreedom.in/staggered-4g-restoration-j-k/) that 4G mobile internet can be restored in select low risk areas. This recommendation was put into effect by the Jammu & Kashmir Government on 16 August 2020 when it restored 4G mobile internet access in one district of Kashmir and one district of Jammu each.

### Pending Supreme Court judgement

The contempt petition filed by FMP was disposed off by the Supreme Court on 11 August 2020 after the Union Government provided information about the meetings of the Special Committee and agreed to staggered 4G restoration in low risk areas. However, the application for directions filed by FMP was kept pending since it highlighted unresolved problems about non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee and lack of periodic review.

In its written reply filed on 25 August 2020, the Union Government has claimed that there exists no legal obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, and publication is necessary only for orders issued by the Home Secretary. In its rejoinder submissions, FMP has asserted that an obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee flows from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The rejoinder submissions were filed by FMP on 13 October 2020 and we are still awaiting the judgement of the Supreme Court on the issue of publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee.

In the meanwhile, the Special Committee was also supposed to examine the outcome of trial restoration of 4G mobile internet access in Ganderbal and Udhampur after two months as per the additional affidavit filed by the Union Government. Since 4G mobile internet was restored in these districts on 16 August 2020, the Special Committee should have held another meeting on or before 16 October 2020 but no information is available in the public domain about when such a meeting was held and whether any further relaxation of internet restrictions was recommended. The orders issued by the Home Secretary of Jammu & Kashmir Government on 21 October 2020 and 12 November 2020 reference a meeting of the Special Committee but they don't provide more specific information.

### Why is publication of review orders necessary?

**(i) Implementation**

The process of review by the Review Committee and the Special Committee is intended to serve as a robust procedural safeguard against arbitrary and disproportionate use of internet shutdowns. However, without disclosure of the recommendations issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, it is impossible for the general public to obtain any information about the outcome of these review processes and whether their recommendations are actually being implemented.

Concerns exist about implementation of the recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee because these bodies performs an advisory role and its findings are not binding in nature. Publication of recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee is the only way to determine if their findings are being implemented, and such bare minimum transparency is necessary to enable aggrieved individuals to seek judicial remedy if their findings are being disregarded. The existence of two separate committees entrusted with the same function of reviewing internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir makes disclosure of recommendations even more important because otherwise, it is impossible for the public to know whether the findings of the two committees were consistent with each other and what were the reasons for disagreement, if any.

**(ii) Independent application of mind**

The Union Government has claimed that publication of orders of the Review Committee is not necessary since it is not a *“new statutory order or directions”* under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. However, the order issued by the Review Committee cannot be considered a mere extension of the order issued by the Home Secretary since such an interpretation would negate the Review Committee’s role as an oversight body which is expected to independently apply its mind to the facts underlying suspension orders.

Under Rule 2(6) of the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, the Review Committee is required to determine if the prevailing situation in an area satisfies the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, which can be invoked only on the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. In order to arrive at this determination, the Review Committee presumably evaluates all relevant material including but not limited to district wise figures of terrorism related incidents, latest information about the impact of internet restrictions and any changes in threat levels between the issuance of the suspension order and the date of review.

The examination of such material by the Review Committee is essential since the Supreme Court has unequivocally held that the geographical and temporal scope of internet restrictions must be narrowly tailored to what is absolutely necessary to combat an emergent situation. Therefore, if the Review Committee is functioning in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court's directions, its orders will provide additional facts and reasoning, and they cannot be considered a mere repetition of the contents of the suspension order issued by the Home Secretary.

>2. It is also a really promising sign for the multiple other #Covid19 vaccines coming up behind Pfizer, as this statement from @CEPIvaccines  points out. They all target the same protein on the #SARSCoV2 virus. Looks like it is a solid approach.

The statement from CEPIvaccines

>“We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other
COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their
immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.

The vaccines from CEPI portfolio that are to be produced in India are the ones by Astrazeneca/Oxford  and Novavax. Earlier this year, one more vaccine backed by CEPI and made by Themis, was said to sign a deal with Serum Institute but I haven't heard anything about it since then. One thing we all should remeber during following vaccine news. Hope that literally all of them  work. Even if there is no chance that you or any other Indian will get it.   


How does moderna and Pfizer's success affect an Indian? It doesn't directly, as there is slim chance we'll get those. But remember, most developed countries have contracts with multiple vaccine manufacturers.   


So, let's say oxford works too. There will be a decrease in demand for oxford vaccine if Canada gets doses from moderna, and those shots can be directed to India, or other third world countries. Similarly, if vaccines from china work, and developing countries decide to take them, there will be less demand from them for oxford vaccine.   


In a nutshell, world is in a positive sum game right now (w.r.t vaccines) and every succesful vaccines affects every single person on this planet, directly or indirectly. https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rtpcr-tests-to-be-doubled-300-more-icu-beds-at-drdo-facility-shah-s-covid-measures-for-delhi-11605450164938.html

> Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday took stock of Delhi's COVID-19 situation in the wake of recent spike in cases in the national capital.

> Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain and senior officers of the central government attended the meeting chaired by Shah.

> After the meeting, Amit Shah said that it has been decided that the number of **RT-PCR tests to be doubled and 300 more ICU beds are to be set up at a DRDO facility in Delhi** .

> ""Mobile Testing Vans of ICMR and Health Ministry to be deployed at vulnerable spots. Few MCD hospitals to be converted into COVID dedicated hospitals for treatment of COVID patients with mild symptoms,"" he said.

> **To increase oxygen beds, 10,000-bedded Chhatarpur COVID care centre to be strengthened, he said.**

> **Additional doctors from CAPFs and paramedical staff to be airlifted to Delhi, in view of shortage of health care workers here.**

> Dedicated multi-department teams to visit all private hospitals in Delhi for inspection of availability of COVID19 medical infrastructure, admission of patients and availability of beds.

> More oxygen cylinders, High Flow Nasal Cannula and other necessary equipment to be made available to Delhi Government by the Central Government.

> ""The big problem now is related to ICU beds. We have seen that after October 20, coronavirus cases have begun to surge rapidly. Covid-19 beds are available. But ICU beds are exhausted quickly. The Central government has given assurance that 500 ICU beds will be made available at DRDO centre and 250 more beds in the coming time. We are also increasing ICU beds at Delhi government facilities,"" 

> **Around 60,000 tests are being conducted daily. We have to increase it to over 1 lakh tests. ICMR has assured to help.

linked article from The hindu: https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-feluda-test-to-be-commercially-available-by-month-end-csir-director-general/article32902741.ece

> The Feluda test, a coronavirus detection test developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and to be commercialised by Tata Sons, **will be commercially available in laboratories this month.**

> The test, which still requires a nasal swab to be collected and sent to a lab, promises to be quicker than the gold-standard test because it doesn’t need the expensive **RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) machine that can set back a lab by at least ₹25 lakh.**

> A smaller, cheaper more portable machine called a **thermocycler, which costs around ₹25,000** , is employed and once the viral RNA is extracted, it takes anywhere from **45 minutes** to an hour to confirm presence of the virus.

> Compared to the RT-PCR test, it’s reportedly cheaper — about ₹500 per test compared to ₹1,200-₹1,600 for RT-PCR, according to current estimates though that would be known only once it’s commercially available in laboratories later this month.

> A major factor that determines how quickly labs are able to process tests is in how quickly they are able to extract viral RNA. There are varying approaches and good labs with **trained personnel can do the job within 15 minutes** but can be a complex process in places with limited facilities.


Found this part the most interesting:

> In theory a saliva sample can be used in a FELUDA-style system but current government regulations don’t permit the use of such tests because there isn’t a standardised process to extract RNA and — the wisdom goes — can lead to many more false negatives. “Our future plans do involve being able to make it a purely home-based test but that’s still some time away,” Mr. Mande said.

How difficult could it be to run parallel experiments by collecting saliva samples too.

I was beginning to think TATA is going slow on this, looks like by end of Nov. this is going to be available. An article on a preprint that says immunity to corona virus might last years.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-immunity.html


> The research, published online, has not been peer-reviewed nor published in a scientific journal. But it is the most comprehensive and long-ranging study of immune memory to the coronavirus to date.

>“That amount of memory would likely prevent the vast majority of people from getting hospitalized disease, severe disease, for many years,” said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology who co-led the new study.


This scientist has [highlighted some important](https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1329056863267155971?s=21 ) bits in the article  A bit irrelevant guys, but it's really great to see the covid thread being active again. The last thread was nearly dead. Two of my cousins organised their weddings in a city  1000km away from mine in November last week and December second week. One of my uncles is crazy and booked a hall for 200 guests. While the cases are going down, I really don't want to risk this. 

My parents made me book flight tickets and they got cancelled. They're now going to travel by car for 1000km (my dad loves to drive). I really don't want to risk this. I'm afraid of a second wave and anything that happens after Diwali. So here is my experience with COVID.My whole family got sick and i live in a joint family we are 7 members even though we all have separate bedrooms it didnt stop we all got infected with it after 2 days of my parents getting sick than my uncle aunt and than myself my couisn and my granny all got sick in 3 days.We kept on checking with oxymeter i was stable with just fever fatigue and complete loss of smell and taste.I just couldnt do anything i was sleeping for 15 hrs straight.My granny had to admited as she is really old aged close to 90.We all recovered even though my dad is still having issues its still under control  1 by 1 everyone recovered their senses.I have still not recovered my sense of smell and taste and the body ache and fatigue is still there.Take care guys this disease is fucking nasty its like having viral infection amplified into 100. **November 16, 2020 - ICMR testing update**

Pretty amusing that even with reduced tests we are having a fall is TPR. One possible explanation is we don't prioritise the tests based on symptoms? first come first serve/ random.

Would like to hear your thought. Mother 61 year old tested positive today. She has diabetes and and taking BP medication. She has absolutely no symptoms. Her Spo2 is allright. We keep checking frequently. Took her to doctor and he gave bunch of medicines with vitamins. What else i can do? Her test report says this and people are saying she’s gotten mild covid

*Since March, a group of volunteers in India's southern state of Kerala have trawled local papers and news networks for reports on deaths due to Covid-19*.

*As of Thursday night, the volunteers had counted 3,356 deaths from the infection in Kerala, which reported its first Covid-19 case in January and the first casualty in March. But the official death toll from the disease is 1,969*.

*""We are missing a lot of Covid-19 deaths here,"" Dr Madhavan told me. He reckons the state has recognised a little more than half of the deaths caused by Covid - and attributed the rest to underlying conditions or co-morbidities.* **No significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo**

*A team of researchers and doctors has now reported the case of one woman with leukemia who had no symptoms of COVID-19 but 70 days after her first positive test, she was still shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles*.

*This result is much longer than previous reports of hospitalised adults found shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus up to 20 days after their COVID-19 diagnosis, plus other accounts of people shedding genetic material from the virus up to 63 days after their symptoms first appeared*.

*The new report should alert doctors and public health experts alike to the fact that people without symptoms and with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, can seemingly shed the SARS-CoV-2 virus for a really long time.

> As many as 19 Indians are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 in a Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flight, which landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi on Friday.

> It’s the largest number of Covid-19 positive cases for any VBM flight to China until now.

> Among the 277 passengers who came on the flight, at least 39 were found to have Covid-19 antibodies – an indication they had the disease but have recovered – and are being monitored.

> As of September 14, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi had said all Indians flying to China on “irregular commercial flights, charter flights or special flights from India to China, double nucleic acid tests of Covid-19, in the labs authorised by the ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research), the first within 120 hours (5 days) before boarding and the second within 36 hours before boarding” were mandatory.

So 19/277 = 6.85% of the people had an active COVID infection & 39/277 = 14% of the people had COVID antibodies.

The University of Oxford, in collaboration with AstraZeneca plc, today announces interim trial data from its Phase III trials that show its candidate vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-2019, is effective at preventing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and offers a high level of protection.

Our vaccine work is progressing quickly. To ensure you have the latest information or to find out more about the trial, please visit the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine web hub or visit the COVID-19 trial website.

Phase 3 interim analysis including 131 Covid-19 cases indicates that the vaccine is 70.4% effective when combining data from two dosing regimens

In the two different dose regimens vaccine efficacy was 90% in one and 62% in the other
Higher efficacy regimen used a halved first dose and standard second dose

Early indication that vaccine could reduce virus transmission from an observed reduction in asymptomatic infections

There were no hospitalised or severe cases in anyone who received the vaccine

Large safety database from over 24,000 volunteers from clinical trials in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, with follow up since April

**Crucially, vaccine can be easily administered in existing healthcare systems, stored at ‘fridge temperature’ (2-8 °C) and distributed using existing logistics**

Large scale manufacturing ongoing in over 10 countries to support equitable global access For those interested in knowing when they can get a vaccine,

Serum Institute was recruiting candidates for their phase 3 trials  in September and October 2020. If things go well, they plan to release ten percent of their vaccine supply to the general public in March. We can estimate a similar timeline for other vaccines based on when they start their phase 3. I don't think the people reading this on reddit will be getting a vaccine through government channels until late 2021, unless you are in the medical field or fall into the vulnerable section of the population.

>Around 40 million (or 4 crore) doses were already ready, said Poonawalla, whose company has collaborated with the government to mass-manufacture the vaccine, reported NDTV. **The 10% of vaccines that were likely to be released to the private market is likely to occur by March.** He said this delay would be due to the time needed to complete licencing procedure.

>“Till then the general public is not likely to get it easily,” he said. “They will have to go to government distribution points and, if they are eligible, then they will get it.

> A day after Delhi reported its highest single-day Covid-19 death toll of 131, crematoriums in the national capital are struggling to cope with the increased fatalities. 

> According to the data from the three municipal bodies, there are 19 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (of confirmed and suspected cases) are being cremated/buried. Of these, eight are run by North Delhi Municipal Corporation (north DMC), six by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). Officials said these facilities can cumulatively dispose of nearly 140-150 bodies daily.

> Authorities assisting in the last rites of those dying of Covid-19 at Nigambodh Ghat said for the past fortnight, there has been a surge in bodies -- every day, about 100 to 110 bodies are being cremated there, of both Covid-19 related deaths and others.

> “More than 60% of them had died of Covid-19 (confirmed cases). Due to Covid death toll spike, the rush at Nigambodh Ghat has increased and people are having to wait longer -- at least five to six hours,” a functionary at the Nigambodh Ghat said, who wished not to be named, said.

> As per data from the SDMC, between November 1 and 18, as many as 883 Covid-19 confirmed dead bodies have been cremated while this figure was 720 in October. Between June 1 and October 31 as many as 3,697 Covid-19 confirmed dead bodies were handled by SDMC crematoriums and graveyards. The other two municipalities were yet to compile this data. Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, SDMC, said the number of cremations has increased in November. “We have sufficient space to increase the capacity, if the situation arises. If required, we will further increase the number of wood pyres,” she said.

> A participant in the phase 1 clinical trials of the Covid vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) fell ill and had to be hospitalised after taking the shot in July, but the trials were not halted and no public disclosure was made. A senior government official told ET that the matter was examined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the sponsor and the report was shared with the Drug Regulatory Authority. It was concluded that the ‘serious adverse event’ was unrelated to the vaccine. “The matter was examined and it was not a big thing that required the ongoing trials to be halted,” said the official.

> Public health experts however find it strange that the trial was not paused. They say this is contrary to the international practice of suspending trials after an adverse event is reported.

> According to people familiar with the development, the volunteer concerned was hospitalised with viral pneumonitis.


https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-vaccine-co-had-adverse-event-experts-seek-more-transparency/articleshow/79334657.cms

> The adverse event occurred in a 35-year old participant with no comorbidities, who was part of Phase 1 trials in August, investigators monitoring the study confirmed to TOI on condition of anonymity.

> The participant, undergoing the trial at a western India site, was hospitalised with viral pneumonitis, a couple of days after being administered the vaccine. He was discharged after a week’s stay in the hospital.

> Experts say there is lack of transparency regarding the vaccine clinical trials in India. As against this, globally, pharma biggies including Pfizer and Moderna have announced detailed data.

You can follow this [thread](https://twitter.com/das_seed/status/1326517334723485696?s=21 ) which has a summary of issues that the user has raised against the covid19 vaccine trials being done in India Adar Poonawal interview with ndtv - https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/news/vaccine-to-centre-for-rs-250-rs-1-000-to-pharmacies-per-dose-adar-poonawalla-to-ndtv-567168?relatedviaplayer

*paraphased transcript*

> 90% effective under what conditions? Adar Poonawala says not to focus too much on the % because it's still too early. The final efficacy test will be when deployed in millions. 

> Initial fear was vaccines within a year, crossing 50%-60% would have been considered great

> Too early to say why lower dose + full dose provides benefits. Will know soon.

> UK phase 3 results by when? Current data will be used for Emergency use - same data will be used. Another 2-3 months in UK for full regular license. Another month in India to apply for emergency usage in India.

> UK MHRA and Indian regulators will share data, could happen in few weeks. But pretty sure about getting it by end of the year based on what regulator feels about the vaccine. This will be limited probably to vulnerable and the old.

> By Jan min. 100 mn doses, Jan-Feb start rolling out 100's of mn of doses

> Govt. target 300-400 mn doses by Jul '21 (maybe a bit from Pfizer / Moderna ... he is skeptical about pricing being in budget though)

> Won't profit initially because scale wouldn't be reached ..... other companies probably will start high and slowly bring down the price as they scale

> MRP of INR 1000, Private market INR 500-600 for vaccine and ~INR 200 for distributors margin

> 90% of the volume to govt. 10% to private market. Govt. will get at INR 250 or less because of volume of the order.

> All prices earlier were per dose

> Will 10% for private market be available immediately ? Available after Feb-Mar when they get full license . Regulatory path won't allow general distribution till then.

> End of Dec - Jan start rolling out the doses

> Dec 14-15 all phase 3 participants in India would have received 2nd dose. A few days post that and global data to apply for  approval. Regulator will decide.

> Works well among the senior citizens. 18 to 90 good amount of immune response.

> Less than 18 will probably take time, traditionally general population safety is established.

> Less than 18 yrs age will have to wait, probably would require separate studies ..... end of next year probably

u/retirednibba looks like teenagers have to wait as suspected

> mRNA vs others : mRNA is great, experimental in the sense that mRNA didn't get us a good response in the past. In pandemic keep things simple, ramping + scaling is easier with proven tech. mRNA success is great - though coldchain etc is a limiting factor. We don't know how long the protection will last.

> Pleasantly surprised with asymptomatic infections, no one else looked at it. It could be a key contribution.

> Plan from now on is using the low dose + high dose efficacy - pleasant surprise. In the beginning you can cover double the population with better result.

> Plan is to amend the US trail and include the lower dose regimen

> 3 great vaccines in the 90% efficacy, we are competing against the virus. Manufacturing and supply will become crucial. We have never vaccinated before with more than 500 mn dose globally in a single year.

>A CDSCO panel has recommended to the Drug Controller General of India, V.G. Somani to allow Biological E Ltd to conduct phase 1 and 2 clinical trial of the covid-19 vaccine in India, a source in the know said. The vaccine has been developed by US-based Baylor College of Medicine.

>Under the agreement, Baylor College will facilitate the technology transfer for the recombinant protein covid-19 vaccine it has developed, while Biological E will scale-up the manufacturing process and undertake further development of the vaccine candidate, including through clinical trials in India.

>In a bid to increase its capacity to manufacture vaccines, the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker had acquired Akorn India Limited, a subsidiary of US-based Akorn Inc, a few days later. The acquisition will give Biological E access to Akorn India’s facilities at Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh

https://science.thewire.in/health/bihar-covid-19-seroprevalence-survey-data-mismatch-nda-assembly-polls/

> But Bihar’s numbers are in a different league altogether – so much so that either the people in Bihar were mysteriously protected from severe forms of the disease or almost none of Bihar’s COVID-19 deaths had been recorded. From international data, we expect 70- to 140-times as many deaths as recorded in the surveyed districts. From Mumbai’s data, we expect about 60 times the recorded deaths. From Delhi’s or Chhattisgarh’s data, we expect about 30-times the recorded deaths. From Chhattisgarh’s data, omitting the predominantly urban districts, we expect about 15-times the recorded deaths. So however we look at it, Bihar’s deaths count doesn’t add up. And taking reporting delays into account makes little difference to this conclusion. Anyone knows the process to get a test in Noida?

> India is in dialogue with the US-based biotech giant Moderna over the progress in the clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine candidate, which the firm said has shown 94.5 percent efficacy, official sources said on Monday.

> ""We are in dialogue not only with Moderna, but also with Pfizer, Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila over the progress of the clinical trials of each of the vaccine candidates and where their vaccines stand in terms safety, immunogenicity and efficacy, and regulatory approvals,"" a source said.

> According to the New Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 2019, any new drug or vaccine which has been tested and got regulatory approval outside India, will have to undergo bridging phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for its secure regulatory approval here.

> As per law, the CDSCO, under the New Drugs and Cosmetics Rule 2019, can omit, relax or abbreviate the regulatory requirement or conditions of submitting pharmaceutical and clinical data of a vaccine candidate in Indian population in case of any emergency or pandemic like situation,"" the source said.

The last point is interesting, looks like they are looking at waiving off bridge trails too. Slightly disappointing. according to sources type article so pinch of salt. Night curfew by state govt in Ahmedabad from 9-6... For good as well because if people knew the official count they'd  have to impose a citywide lockdown. 

(PS they're fudging numbers by an unbelievable amount. Source: am Frontline healthcare worker doing covid duty. Lmao, our medical clg authorities are saying since they never gave any official notice about suspension of UG classes, hence they won't issue any official reopening notice( read won't take any responsibility if students get sick) and we have to give our professional exams without clinical postings or exposure. Since supposedly we considered ourselves equivalent to General colleges and went on ""vacation"" without permission, so we missed clinical postings and won't be repeated. 

This happens after, a. the erstwhile MCI's notice about following Ministry of Health guidelines regarding suspension, b. us being asked to empty hostel's from the beginning of lockdown till last month, C. submitting online assignments after assignments for ""attendance"" like slaves, d. normal patients being moved and replaced by COVID 19 patients, so clinical postings were pretty much not possible.

Being a medical student really sucks hard, especially when our future colleagues are busy trying pin nonexistent blame upon us in the midst of a pandemic.

( I am really sorry for this rant, and I don't even know if this is the right place to do so. AlsoI did not mean to say that  clgs shouldn't be opened. I think they should have started a month ago. But this blame game is really frustrating.) 

At points it feels like common people are just the ""tools"" for the people in power to play with. [Immunity to coronavirus lingers for months, study finds](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/29/health/covid-immunity-lingers-months-wellness/index.html)

Real good news! https://publicreleases.com/2020/10/23/maharashtra-registers-34-drop-in-demand-for-medical-oxygen/

> A senior health department official said the state hospitals’ daily demand for medical oxygen has gone down to 430-450 tonnes from almost 600-650 tonnes a day in the beginning of October. “This is almost over 200 tonnes of reduction, on a daily basis, in the medical oxygen requirement as of now. This is primarily because of the reduction in the active Covid-19 cases,” he said. 

> “From 229 tonnes per day requirement of medical oxygen in Pune district as on October 1, the need has come down to 140 tonnes by October 20. **This is a drop by almost 39%** . In case of Pune division, the daily demand for medical oxygen has come down to 210 tonnes by October 20 from 372 tonnes per day as on October 1. **This is a drop by 44%.** ” 

> Pratapwar said the drop in oxygen requirement of hospitals was due to the reduction in the Covid-19 active caseload in Pune division. “ **Another reason is the divisional commissioner’s order around September-end on forming committees to monitor use of oxygen in hospitals** . The committees were to monitor if oxygen was being used rationally by the hospitals. The committees came across instances of irrational use of oxygen by some hospitals,” he said. 

> A source from the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers’ Association (AIIGMA), who also has several gas manufacturing units in Maharashtra, told TOI, “The demand for medical oxygen has dropped wherever my units are located. We have so far seen almost a 75%-80 % decrease in the requirement of medical oxygen in October in districts such as Pune, Mumbai, Raigad and Ratnagiri.”

these kind of statements are really puzzling. do we have any guidance or predictions from india experts for india ? or are we just going to come out unscathed and experts will be left scratching their heads how india did it ? sorry my brain cannot handle the incongruity France Germany Belgium UK US and now even Iran is in a bad place.

Edit Add poland, spain, croatia to that list Mutated coronavirus from mink is a threat to humans

The situation regarding corona infection among mink has now developed to a critical stage in North Jutland.

According to B.T.'s information, a mutated coronavirus migrated from mink to humans and has since spread strongly among the citizens of Vensyssel in North Jutland.

On Tuesday, the government received a note from the Statens Serum Institut, which has exposed the mutated coronavirus to antibodies. The result, according to SSI, was deeply troubling because the mutated coronavirus did not respond well to the antibodies.

Thus, there is a risk that a possible vaccine against covid-19 will not have the desired effect if the mutated virus from mink spreads further among humans.

That is why Mette Frederiksen has convened a press conference on Wednesday at 4 pm, where she herself will participate virtually.

B.T. learns that there are new restrictions for humans on the way in northern Jutland to stop the spread of the coronavirus from mink.

The other party leaders were summoned to a briefing on Wednesday afternoon Not many in news but now friends, relatives are testing positive..I am getting scared by looking at how lax everyone seems in market & public places Some lovely news!! [Pfizer and BioNTech say their COVID-19 vaccine is over 90% effective](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27P1CT)

> Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the world’s economy and upended daily life.

> Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine.

> Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. authorization for emergency use of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of safety data from about half the study’s 44,000 participants, which his expected late this month.

> Pfizer and BioNTech have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They have also reached supply agreements with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

> To save time, the companies began manufacturing the vaccine before they knew whether it would be effective. They now expect to **produce up to 50 million doses, or enough to protect 25 million people this year.**

> **Pfizer said it expects to produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.**

> The U.S. pharmaceutical giant said the **interim analysis was conducted after 94 participants** in the trial developed COVID-19, examining how many of them had received the vaccine versus a placebo.

> The company **did not break down exactly** how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine. Still, over **90% effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 people who caught COVID-19 had been given the vaccine** , which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart.



Edit: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against

[TOI article](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/sero-survey-shows-near-50-citizens-already-have-covid-antibodies/articleshow/79137820.cms)|[outline](https://outline.com/kKScZD)

> Some 49.7% people surveyed tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, say the much awaited results of the sero survey conducted in October across Nagpur district.

> Though not officially declared, sources confirmed to TOI on Monday that out of 2,000-odd samples collected from various parts of Nagpur city, almost half had Covid-19 antibodies.

> Total 2,000 samples were collected from city, 200 each from 10 zones Each zone divided into 4 clusters, with 50 samples collected
Samples collected from healthy people who had never been tested for Covid-19 were preferred

> In clusters like Satranjipura and Mominpura, where entire locality was tested during the pandemic, authorities preferred citizens who had tested negative in tests

> In Nagpur rural, samples collected from all 13 tehsils, with 50 samples from 3 high prevalence villages


> In other words, if one considers Nagpur’s population at about 30 lakh; then nearly 15 lakh people in Nagpur have already been infected by Covid-19, stayed asymptomatic or experienced mild symptoms, and recovered.

> While Nagpur city’s average prevalence is 49.7%, the zone wise details may tell a different story. Crowded localities like Mominpura, Naik Talao, Sakkardara, Mahal, and Itwari have more than 55% to 60% sero prevalence while other areas in city have less than 50%

> Final zone and cluster wise figures of this survey are expected to be released on November 10.

> According to specialist doctors, this high prevalence of Covid-19 is a strong indicator that the second wave, whenever it comes, may not be very intense. But, they also asked people not to be careless about Covid precautions. 

> 4,000 | Samples collected from across district ; 49.7% | from city had Covid-19 antibodies ; 20.7% | from Nagpur rural had antibodies ; **35.2% | Overall Nagpur district average with antibodies** In today’s COVID bulletin for the state of Karnataka, there is a new announcement asking all private healthcare facilities to contact District health and family welfare officers, regarding COVID-19 vaccination of health staff.

> Experts have said the current third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in the national capital, the worst so far, could last for another four to five days, according to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday. “It seems Delhi’s Covid-19 cases are at peak now and experts say it can last for four to five days. Delhi’s overall death ratio is 1.59%,” Jain said.

> He attributed the rising number of Covid-19 cases to the fact that many people were still not wearing face masks. “Many people aren’t wearing masks. Most cases are from the working class,” he said, adding that 110 intensive care unit (ICU) beds were added to the total capacity of government hospitals.

> On Sunday, the minister pointed out that the national capital had hit the peak of the third wave of Covid-19 and said that the increase in the number of cases could be due to aggressive testing and contact-tracing.

*Sputnik vaccine completes the 2nd interim analysis*

> The efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine is 91.4%, based on the second interim analysis of data obtained 28 days after administering the first dose (7 days after the second dose). 

> Calculation was based on the analysis of data on volunteers (n = 18,794) who received both the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine or placebo at the second control point **(39 confirmed cases as of November 23, 2020)** in accordance with the clinical trial protocol.

> Preliminary data from volunteers obtained 42 days after the first dose (corresponds with 21 days after the second dose) indicates an efficacy of the vaccine above 95%.

> Currently, 40,000 volunteers are taking part in the Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical post-registration study of the Sputnik V vaccine in Russia, of whom more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and second doses.

> The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform that has proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 clinical trials globally conducted during the past two decades - while the history of the use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development began in 1953. More than 100,000 people have received approved and registered drugs based on human adenoviral vectors.

> According to the protocol of Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, its interim efficacy is calculated at three statistically significant representative check points - upon reaching 20, 39 and 78 cases of novel coronavirus infection among volunteers both in the placebo group and in the group that received the vaccine


Sputnik has updated the results based on second interim point as 91% based on 39 infections, The announcement 2 weeks back was based on 20 infections.

The additional claim of 95% efficacy is not a standard reporting method, gives insights into vaccine immune response though. Some more clarity on Oxford/AZ vaccine - mixed news, tending towards negative.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/astra-vaccine-s-90-efficacy-in-covid-came-in-younger-population

> The dose of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid vaccine that showed the highest level of effectiveness was **tested in a younger population than a bigger dose that showed less efficacy** , according to the head of the U.S. Operation Warp Speed program.

> The vaccine being developed with Oxford University was 90% effective when a half-dose was given before a full-dose booster, the partners said on Monday. However, **that regime was administered to participants in a group whose age was capped at 55** , Warp Speed’s Moncef Slaoui said Tuesday in a phone call with reporters.

> There was no age breakdown given for the two groups from AstraZeneca when the company reported its results on Monday. **The initial half-dose was used in some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials** , Slaoui said.

> Older people have a weaker response than younger people to some vaccines, like flu shots. **Results from a phase 2 study of the Astra-Oxford vaccine published last week in The Lancet medical journal confirmed a strong response to the vaccine in older people** .


The age cap makes the data difficult to compare - EUA is going to be focused on older, frontline and vulnerable - how the regulators will look at this messiness is a question. Oxford's did do a study of older cohort which showed a similar immune behaviour so a positive . 

In addition to this, their methods and protocols for Brazil,UK arm were different. Their US arm is different as well & they have said in interviews that they are attempting to modify the protocol in US to half + full - if so this again will take time. I wonder if this played a role in the long delay ( after the adverse event pause ) for FDA to allow resumption of enrollment in US. Pretty sure FDA must have dug this even though the event itself was part of the UK arm.

The most likely scenario now, imo , is full + full getting EUA and Oxford/AZ running parallel study (modified protocol or otherwise) to prove efficacy of half + full dose (or even half + half dose I hope) with greater confidence. If this happens, a decent hit on speed of coverage.

> The government has planned to start the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine first to the healthcare workers followed by other groups to be added ""sequentially"".

> The distribution drive would take place over a year. For this, the states and union territories would form a three-tier system as per the Centre's directions.

> As per the information gathered, the three-tier committees would comprise the state steering committee, state task force, and district task force in each state and UT. 

> The state steering committee would be headed by the chief secretary, the state task force would be headed by the principal secretary (health), while the district task force would be led by the district magistrate.

> The committees should meet at a minimum frequency of once a month, once a fortnight, and once a week, respectively, the directions added.


Interesting that they are trying to tackle misinformation too:

> Once the vaccine is available, the committee's duties will include tracking social media for misinformation, ensuring active involvement of stakeholders, and undertaking regular reviews of vaccine coverage.

> Once the distribution of the vaccine starts, the district task force would work on developing ""robust communication planning at all levels to address rumour-mongering as well as vaccine eagerness"". https://twitter.com/BallouxFrancois/status/1324085761449304067?s=19

> The group's findings, recently published by the journal Microorganisms, confirm that the virus originated in China and most likely jumped into humans from horseshoe bats

> But it is Europe, not China, which has been the main source for spreading the disease around the world.

> Travel restrictions across Britain and Europe seem to have been too little and too late, and most of the spread of the virus to America and other parts of the world was via Europe, not directly from China. What's the consensus here for a sudden reduction is positive cases? 

Don't want to be a conspiracy nut but is something cooking behind the scenes to show fewer cases? 

Also, the testing seems to be still at 10 lakh/day on average. If the positive cases are decreasing, does that mean at least _some_ states have controlled the spread?

> His company has already produced more than 20 million doses of the vaccine and expects that figure to have reached 50 million by the end of the year. Another 1.3 billion doses are planned to be manufactured in 2021.

> ""Once they give us the green light, our goal is to start shipping in a couple of hours. Will lockdown restrictions be completely removed once the healthcare workers and high risk groups get vaccinated, which I'm assuming will be done by Jan if it gets approved? I read the news of increasing the vitamin D content. I haven’t been able to reach my family doctor for last few days 
Can someone suggest me vitamin D supplement in India? https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/coronavirus-telangana-braces-for-likely-surge-in-covid-19-cases/article32998430.ece

> Eight months into the pandemic, Health department officials are estimating another surge in cases as a large number of people stepped out of home for Bathukamma and Dasara festivals.

> Besides, since any virus finds cold temperatures favourable, officials opined that COVID’s virulence might increase in the winter.

> However, these two are not the sole reasons for estimated surge. The recent floods in Hyderabad and large gatherings during election campaigning could also contribute to the possibility. 

> One of the important observations is regarding the drop in the number of daily COVID deaths. While eight to 10 deaths were reported till September-end, it gradually dropped to four to six deaths per day. Telangana High Court on October 12 said the death statistics furnished by the Public Health department were not trustworthy.

> Senior officials of Health department insist the deaths are not under-reported. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said that with better understanding of the infectious disease and drugs such as steroids and heparin, they have been able to bring down the death rate. He remarked earlier people underwent testing only when symptomatic. “Precious time was lost and the disease progressed. Now, we are reaching out to people and identifying cases in early stages. Treatment starts even when a person is asymptomatic which avoids disease progression,” he said. https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/haryana-survey-finds-sero-prevalence-in-14-8-per-cent-population-6914002/

> Haryana has found antibodies against SARSCoV-2 among **14.8 percent** of the state’s population in the second round of seroprevalence survey released on Monday.

> In the first round of survey conducted in August, seroprevalence was 8 per cent across the state.

> “Rural areas of Faridabad and Jind were districts were found to have the highest positivity rate of 25.5 per cent. **Urban areas of Faridabad, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts had the highest sero-positivity rates of 40.2 per cent, 37.1 per cent and 36.3 per cent, respectively”** .

> Vij said the survey was conducted in all 22 districts of Haryana in collaboration with Department of Community Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak. “It was conducted by taking 720 persons from each district, including both urban and rural population,” he added. I have to take an unavoidable flight on the 16th of November. I already have a Face shield with me. I also have a 3-layered/3-ply cotton mask that I had purchased from an online store. Would it be a better idea to wear some other type of mask during the flight? Something that may be more effective? Also, if there is, could someone please point me to a link to purchase it? Thanks! Anyone used govt's e-Sanjeevani online OPD? How was your experience?

Edit: So I tried the android app. For first couple of instances, the video call wasn't connecting for some reason. Tried with another mobile and it connected. Process thereafter went smoothly, the doctor was polite as well. He asked a couple of questions, gave a prescription which had medicines and a few do's and don'ts. Overall it was a pleasant experience. So, for minor ailments that do not require physical examination, I would recommend e-Sanjeevani app. Mumbai folks, how's the situation their. How many people are out on the roads, and how many wear masks? Do you sense some individualistic measures that people are taking, which is contributing to decreasing cases?

The data seems to suggest things getting better for mumbai. Their TPR is less than 10%, which is better compared to their peak TPRs, even if we if consider false negatives of antigen tests. Active cases are lowest since 16th May, so lowest in almost 6 months. Covid centers are also getting shut. We should suspect data fudging, but I think situation in mumbai is really getting better. I'm not currently in mumbai, so I don't have ground report.

So, how are things overall in the city? How are things right now in your area? 

Question for everyone too. Theories/explanation about current covid situation in mumbai. TIFR's prediction about mumbai 2-3 months are looking to be true. [Don’t Make Mine Mink By Derek Lowe](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/11/05/dont-make-mine-mink)

> Like the current coronavirus. Back in the spring and early summer, mink farmers in the Netherlands reported coronavirus outbreaks in their animals, and this was followed by reports from Denmark and other countries in Europe. Utah fur ranches reported coronavirus outbreaks in their mink populations (with thousands of dead animals) in August.

>  On both continents, it’s believed that the disease spread from the human farm workers into the mink populations. Different mammals have different susceptibilities to the virus (to any virus), and it appears that Covid-19 is highly transmissible in mink. Its mortality rate is not high, fortunately, but high enough given the huge numbers of animal involved. 

> For “herd immunity” fans, the outbreaks seem to tail off once about 90% of the population has been exposed, but that’s a lot higher number than you’d ever want to hit, and it’s also worth noting that the human population is not well modeled by the conditions on a mink farm. Yet.

> The coronavirus has spread and mutated in the Danish mink population, and now there have been cases of these strains jumping back into humans and causing infections there. This was first seen in a single case in the Netherlands in the spring (more here), and it’s happened a number of times since. It gets worse: reports have it that some of the current mink strains in Denmark are less susceptible to antibody responses.

> Now, I am not completely sure what that means. I have been trying to find published details, but it seems to be too early, and the press reports are full of other baffled scientists waiting for information. The Serum Science Institute in Denmark seems to be the place where these effects were found, and they’ve shared their findings with the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control

> Kåre Mølbak of that institute said at a press conference that the situation is “very serious” and that the worst case would be a restarted pandemic spreading out of Denmark. The article also says, rather alarmingly, that “The Serum Institute estimates that five percent of the viral infections among people in North Jutland are of the new type of virus mutation“, and I would very much like to hear some more about that.

To be clear a lot of this is currently based on press releases and most of the alarming statements are a bit of speculating on what the worst case could be. Things should become clearer as they release more data and studies.

> It is estimated that about 46 million doses to be available in Brazil until January of 2021.

> To date, 74 volunteers have been infected, a number higher than the minimum required for this stage, which provided for at least 61 contaminated participants.

> The results will be sent by the independent International Committee in the first week of December for Anvisa (National Health Surveillance Agency) to analyze the report to verify the vaccine developed by Butantan in an international partnership with the biopharmaceutical Sinovac Life Science.

> Tests in Brazil have been coordinated since July by Butantan in 16 scientific research centers spread across seven Brazilian states and the Federal District. 

> In total, there are 13,000 volunteers involved in studies in Brazil. The research uses the double blind model, in which half of the volunteers receive doses of vaccine, while the others a placebo without efficiency against the disease. With the opening of the study, it will be possible to identify how many contaminated volunteers were or were not protected by the immunizer

This relates to the Coronavac by the Chinese company Sinovac. China,Brazil,Chile,Indonesia and Turkey have preliminary agreement to procure these. Could play a large role in poorer countries along with Oxford. Price for various contracts have been in $10-$15 per dose - 2 dose regimen.

Brazil - 46 mn expected by Jan '21  , deal for   60 mn doses to be delivered by Feb '21. local manufacturing capable of 100 mn doses per year being setup in Sau paulo   
Chile - 20 mn, timeframe unknown, depending on Brazil's regulatory approving the vaccine    
China - already being used for healthcare workers and other high exposure groups. Manufacturing in Beijing that could scale upto 300 mn doses per year once vaccine is approved    
Indonesia - 50 mn doses to be delivered starting Nov '20 till Mar '21. Bio Farma will manufacture locally once vaccine is approved - 250 mn doses per year planned
Turkey - 10 mn people to be delivered by Dec '20, total deal of 20 mn DON'T TRUST THE NUMBERS! I have been saying it for a long time, and just now my family is realizing it.

My friends from UP/Bihar are telling me many hospitals there are currently filed to the max.

While the Media is focusing on Delhi, the rest of the country is slipping under the radar. It's bad everywhere! 

Pretend it's a lockdown, stop doing unnecessary activities, and stay at home. Everything else can wait. Take care of your family!

> Nearly half of Karnataka’s population was infected by Covid-19 by August - not just in urban areas, but in the villages too - according to a private serosurvey conducted between mid-June and August

> Adjusted seroprevalence implies that approximately **31.5 million** of Karnataka’s residents - or **46.7%** - were infected by the virus in the past. This is **96.4 times the number of cases** - 3.27 lakh - reported by Department of Health by August 29.

> The **IDFC Institute** released the findings of the seroprevalence survey by experts at Duke University, **University of Chicago** , Mapmygenome and **Center for Monitoring Indian Economy**. It was funded by ACT Grants. 

> Adjusted seroprevalence in rural Karnataka was **44.1% and 53.8% in urban areas** , while it was **46.7% for the state as a whole** , suggesting that rural areas were almost equally affected, contrary to the perception that only urban areas would be more vulnerable to Covid-19 due to higher population density.

> Between 1.5% and 1.7% in rural areas and 4% and 10.5% in urban areas tested positive on a RT-PCR test

> The study used **ELISA** tests to detect the presence of antibodies specific to Covid-19 and ran **pooled RT-PCR** tests to determine current infections. The study sample comprised **2,912 households across 20 districts** drawn from an existing, representative sample of a panel survey, the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy’s **Consumer Pyramids Household Survey** . 

> Areas were divided into 5 homogenous regions (HR) - Bengaluru HR, Belagavi HR, Kalaburagi HR, Mysuru HR and Coastal HR - that is an area comprised of neighbouring districts in a state which have similar agro-climatic conditions, urbanization rates, and female literacy

Summary of survey region wise:

This guy really needs to start making sense lol. Okay I don't know if this has been discussed here before but I really can't wrap my head around how the covid numbers have started going down so drastically in India. It's great that's it's happening but I'm just wondering how. There's no lockdown, numbers are way too less to suggest herd immunity, streets and other outdoors have begun to get crowded for a while in most major cities and yet the numbers have rapidly declined. What's at play here? Just a combination of improved personal hygiene routines and people not really testing anymore despite symptoms? do you guys think we ll see another huge surge?

* usa is now doing 120k+ daily
* hell Europe s completely screwed, France did 80k+ yesterday, Italy etc are also doing heavy number of cases
* what is your opinion? Iss thread me desh corona ke khilaf jang jeetega! May this be the final Coronavirus Megathread in this sub. 🙏 The Southern Hemisphere was lucky to implement lockdown during winter. Now that Northern Hemisphere is unlocking as Winter is approaching, things might get interesting.

>This is a big unanswered question but the science leans towards yes. This is largely based on what we know about other viruses.

So, it's not clear whether cold temperatures help viruses directly or whether human behavior of staying indoors during winter leads to increase in spreading infection. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/icu-beds-in-short-supply-as-covid-tally-nears-4-lakh/articleshow/79008172.cms

> At least 40 hospitals in Delhi — mostly private-run — have run out of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. 

> In public hospitals, too, the data shared at 8pm on Monday showed, there is a serious shortage of ICU beds, with and without ventilator support.

> “The number of persons developing severe symptoms and those requiring ICU care have gone up. This could be due to the double impact of Covid-19 and pollution. Both are known to affect lung function,” he said. 

> Lok Nayak Hospital, which is run by Delhi government, had only eight Covid-19 beds with ventilators available on Monday. The number of ICU beds without a ventilator at the hospital was 79. Safdarjung and AIIMS Trauma Centre that are run by the Centre had one and five beds with ventilators available, respectively. 

> Among private hospitals, Apollo, Max Saket and Fortis Vasant Kunj did not have a single ICU bed available.

Looking at the data on covid19india.org , Delhi currently has 33,308 active cases. Wave 1 peak active cases ~26.5k, wave 2 peak active cases ~ 32k. What the hell is happening in Delhi. And NCR. Gurgaon reporting 500 plus cases for the first time. :/ Mumbai and Delhi have almost the same populations

Mumbai has been doing around 11000 tests a day ( as of day before yesterday) where as delhi did 50000. 

Why is this not remarked upon? https://mybigplunge.com/life/health/covid19/india-get-covishield-covid-19-vaccine-far-cheaper-rate-serum-institute/

> Serum Institute of India, looking at selling the COVID-19 vaccine Covishield at **$5 to $6 per dose** , will be giving it to the Government of India at a far cheaper rate. Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of SII, at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit said it will probably will be around **$3 to $4 because they’ll be buying very huge volumes** of hundreds of millions of doses.

> He said the company would be applying for an **emergency use authorization** from the Drug Controller General of India for its vaccine **next month, and get the regulatory greenlight in January. **

> “We are basing the assumption of an emergency licensure based on positive UK results. That **if we get good UK result end of November or early December** , we apply for an emergency licensure use,” Poonawalla explained. “So you have the **vaccine for the vulnerable populations by January or February.** And then by **March or April, for the general public.** ” 

> He highlighted that if things go according to plan, the company plans to have around **300 to 400 million shots of the two-dose vaccine ready by March or April.**

> “At the moment, we are at a **50 to 60 million capacity** on a monthly basis as an output, **by February, we will have gone to 100 million doses per month** ,” Poonawalla said. “Right now I have dedicated two facilities for Covishield production and will dedicate another two facilities by January or February, which are getting validated.”

> Poonawalla also said that the Serum Institute **does not plan to sign pacts with other countries** because it may not be able to provide vaccines to those countries. 

> He said India’s one billion plus population will be the company’s primary concern. Poonawalla said efforts were on to make the vaccine affordable for all at an initial price range of Rs 500 to Rs 600.

Few significant developments,   

* will not sign pacts with other countries! huge pull back of their ambitions but improves access to India. I feel this might have been misrepresented..will wait for a more reputable website to publish. SII has a deal with GAVI/the WHO or Bill Gates' low cost corona alliance for poor countries for making available low cost doses. Unlikely they will just back out of it. At best I guess no new deals is what he may have stated.    
Edit : check out the livemint version below, SIIs commitment to COVAX/GAVI facility is still on. They are also exploring deals with Nepal and few African nations.  As expected this was shoddy reporting.

* Claims of March/April availability for general public - 300 to 400 mn dose by this time - very aggressive ramp   

* ""only"" 50-60 million doses per month till Feb. ; earlier their plans were to ramp to 100 mn doses per month from 
Jan. with 50% available for India ..... ~~but now if they don't supply to other countries it won't affect supply to India.~~       

Edit: livemint version implies a total of 100 million from Feb. 

> “At the moment, we're at a 50-60 million capacity on a monthly basis as an output, by February, we will have gone to 100 million doses per month. Right now I've dedicated two facilities (for Covishield production) and will dedicate another two facilities by January (or) February, which are getting validated,"" he said adding that the doubling of monthly output is for both India and COVAX.

* An INR 500 to 600 vaccine will be mind blowing really.

edit: Even better, as per live mint this is the price in private market. 

I am hoping private enterprises, schools, colleges will be allowed to do their own independent procurement! Govt. procured and subsidized for economically weak and direct procurement for those who can. To address the concerns about rich getting undue benefit or pay to skip queue ... some kind right to first procurement to the govt. / right to first refusal. If govt. is unable to buy at that point in time, SII can offer in open market.


EDIT: https://www.livemint.com/news/india/serum-institute-may-sell-oxford-vaccine-at-5-6-per-dose-in-the-private-market-11605799832718.html

> Serum Institute may sell covid-19 vaccine Covishield at around **₹500- ₹600 per dose in the private market** , around twice the $3 per shot it will cost the Indian government as well as the COVAX facility, chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Thursday.

> “Government of India will be getting it at far cheaper, probably around $3-4 because they'll be buying very huge volumes of hundreds of millions of doses. So they'll get the access to the price which is similar to what COVAX has got, which is $3 and the general public probably have to pay around ₹500- ₹600,"" Poonawalla said.

> The company is in talks with **Nepal and certain African countries** , but has not signed a bilateral pact for vaccine supply with any other country other than Bangladesh. For Africa, Poonawalla said, he expects COVAX to handle a significant proportion of doses.

> Serum Institute does not plan to sign pacts with other countries currently because it may not be able to provide vaccines to those countries, especially since India’s 1 billion plus population will be the company’s primary concern, he said.

> Going forward, the company also has plans to mas **manufacture a vaccine developed by US-based Novavax, and three other candidates** , and the company plans to **launch one of those vaccines every three to four months** , with **Novavax’s candidate expected by the April or May** , he said.

> Pune-based Serum Institute has also signed pacts with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for manufacturing and delivery of **up to 200 million doses of covid-19 vaccines from Oxford and Novavax for COVAX** --a facility jointly established by Gavi, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for equitable access to covid-19 vaccines.

> In return, the company has received $300 million to fund the operation, a very risky one considering that the company would be manufacturing the vaccines even before it has received regulatory approval. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-dosing/dosing-error-turns-into-lucky-punch-for-astrazeneca-and-oxford-idUSKBN28327Q

> A stroke of good fortune from a dosing error will pave the way for AstraZeneca and Oxford University to submit their COVID-19 vaccine for regulatory clearance.

> “The reason we had the half-dose is serendipity,” Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca’s non-oncology research and development, told Reuters.

> Around the time when Astra was initiating its partnership with Oxford at the end of April, university researchers were administering doses to trial participants in Britain.

> They soon noticed expected side effects such as fatigue, headaches or arm aches were milder than expected, he said.

> “So we went back and checked ... and we **found out that they had underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half**,” said Pangalos.

PS: Sorry, I thought I had posted the update, had missed it. I have added PCR numbers from June 1^st - [used covid-19 API to extract data](https://api.covid19india.org/documentation/csv/) . Now totals and PCR can be compared on a like to like basis in rankings - same number of days. https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aktuality.sk%2Fclanok%2F836418%2Fkoronavirus-online-slovensko-2-november-2020%2F

> Coronavirus: 3.6 million people came across the area test, 1% tested positive

> 15:55 - TESTING:  The worst performers were mainly in the north of Slovakia, such as Čadca (3.22%), Stará Ľubovňa (2.8%) or Púchov (2.65%). The lowest infection was detected by antigen tests in the districts of Revúca (0.27%), Banská Štiavnica (0.28%) and Rožňava (0.29%).

> 19:53 - BRATISLAVA:  Bratislava had the fifth lowest share of positive tests among other districts in Slovakia within the nationwide testing for COVID-19 disease. With a share of 0.33 percent, it placed behind the districts of Veľký Krtíš (0.31 percent), Rožňava (0.29 percent), Banská Štiavnica (0.28 percent) and Revúca (0.27 percent).

> 19:12 - SECOND ROUND: The Prime Minister Igor Matovič informs that the second round of nationwide testing will take place in districts in which the proportion of those infected in the first round was higher than 0.7%. Exceptions include, for example, Košice or Bratislava.

Basically Slovakia made negative test results compulsory for working and non-essential shopping. They had a 2 day nationwide drive for testing (optional for children and Older people ). Now districts with > 0.7% will be tested again.

They were having 2.5k cases per day, so this represent about 2 weeks of detection. Now am not sure how they are handling false positives since prevalence is low but pretty impressive job.

Logically even in India we can try this for districts with high TPR....divert antigen kits from UP/Bihar where TPR is <2%.

Edit : https://domov.sme.sk/c/22525330/vysledky-plosne-testovanie-mapa-okresy-slovensko.html - district wise results https://theprint.in/health/how-many-rat-rt-pcr-tests-has-india-conducted-dont-have-data-ask-states-says-icmr/538513/

> The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) does not maintain a database of the specific number of rapid antigen tests (RAT) and RT-PCR tests being administered for Covid-19 at the national level or across states, the apex medical research body has revealed.

> Speaking to ThePrint about the process that is being followed currently, a senior official with the ICMR said maintaining specific data is the responsibility of the states.

> ThePrint reached a MeitY official, who said that while the NIC has developed the portals, only ICMR can access them. “This data is visible in the ICMR-designated labs… Even though the application is being hosted by NIC, the data is controlled by ICMR. They have the username and password,” said the official, who didn’t wish to be identified, in a telephonic interview.

> “If you have raw data, whatever reports you want to generate you can generate, if you are a technical person,” he said.

> A second ICMR official confirmed that the data is being stored in the cloud and reports are generated as and when a higher authority requires it. “For research purposes, we can cull out the data and make the report,” he said. 

> Asked if the ICMR regularly generates reports on the two tests, he said, “The ICMR doesn’t use this, it’s the state authorities who use this. We just keep data on the cumulative tests.” My friend is planning to travel from Pune to Honnavar(KA). I have already told her to get a Covid test report 2 days before travel. What are the other things to keep in mind? Is there any checklist? Also are there any restrictions like Quarantine for people arriving through International Travel to Pune? I can't believe that the Government finally released the backend code of Arogya Setu.  Seems too good to be true. Let's hope that its not another act of deceit.

> The Delhi High Court on Thursday pulled up the Delhi government for its delayed action in controlling the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital while seeking to know why it was waiting for the court’s order to reduce the number of attendees at the weddings.

> On Thursday, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that they have reduced the number of wedding attendees. He said that people are being fined for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing norms.

> However, the court said that even fining people is not acting as a deterrent and people who have not stepped outside of their houses due to the fear of the infection have also contracted the virus.

*this is hilarious , everybody lies mi lord*

> The court said that it is disheartening to note that the number of deaths have been increasing on a daily basis with the highest number of deaths shooting up to 134. Justice Kohli asked the Delhi government to indicate the steps they are taking to ensure that there are adequate facilities for victims of Covid-19 at the burning ghats and crematoriums.

> The court also said that the Delhi government should be cognizant of the fact that rapid antigen tests are no longer helping because of the large number of asymptomatic persons, while adding that more RT-PCR tests should be conducted for better results. 

> During the proceedings, the court noted in its order that the Delhi government is not conducting the fifth sero-survelliance stating that the third wave of Covid-19 is still in progress, even though the government told the press that the third wave has already peaked in the city.

*Excuses, damed excuses and Delhi govt's logic*

> When additional standing counsel of the Delhi government Satyakam objected and urged the court not to take not of anything that has been published in the press, the court said, “Why would not we take this? We can take judicial note of the statements made by your ministers in the court. If you retract from whatever you have said in the media, I would remove it.”

----------------------------------------------
*additional obs.*    

* All the states that look like they we going on an uncontrolled growth seem to be in early stages of stablisation    
* India looks to be converging to a plateau in 40-45k range
* Globally USA and Europe look like they are close to their peaks - we should start seeing clear indications int he next 3-4 days. Very optimistic about Europe turnaround - France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, UK have clearly turned the corner. Slightly doubtful about France's numbers - I feel they will dump a bunch of results soon - but fairly confident the epidemic has flattened there    
* In our neighbourhood, Pak and Bangladesh continue to show the sustained resurgence - Pakistan in a very similar fashion to NW-India Vaccinations in the US for Pfizer may start in December only. Any estimates when vaccination with the Oxford one will start in India? It seems there has been some error from Astrazeneca regarding the vaccine. Cannot see more details about it. Is the error about the dosing inconsistency (2 v/s 1.5) or something more serious? u/Krab_em if you can shed some light. finally, 

[**About 22.1% found positive for antibodies in UP’s sero survey**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/about-22-1-found-positive-for-antibodies-in-up-s-sero-survey/story-pirjTbKgKYyI65hRon3Y5K.html)

>“The survey in 11 districts of the state was carried out and about 16,000 samples were taken and tested at King George’s Medical University for detection of antibodies. These were the districts that had a high number of cases. The results revealed that about 22.1% of the samples were having presence of antibodies,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).

>The officials, however, did not reveal the district-wise percentage. [Vaccine works against mutated mink coronavirus in early animal trials: Danish scientist](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark-mink-idUSKBN27S2JL)

> A potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said on Thursday.

> Early studies of the mutated virus strain, known as Cluster 5, showed the virus to have a reduced sensitivity towards antibodies, possibly compromising the efficacy of future vaccines, authorities said last week.

> “We couldn’t resist testing the rabbit antibodies we have against Cluster 5, and it works,” Fomsgaard told Danish broadcaster DR on Thursday.

I guess we can put those vaccine trouble concerns to rest now. [deleted] I guess there isnt any hope for any concrete steps in Delhi till next week. Things are bad but it would be politically disastrous to institute restrictions during Diwali. **November 13, 2020 - ICMR testing update**

> “Based on our observations, its effectiveness is also more than 90%. The appearance of another effective vaccine - this is good news for everyone,” Drapkina said.

> “In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high,” he said.

^ Read this in a Russian accent, picture a mob boss :P

> Russia is gearing up to publish preliminary results of an ongoing large-scale human trial, known as Phase III, this month. It is testing the vaccine on 40,000 people in Moscow.

If this has a 90% effectiveness too, it will be better news for India . Dr.Reddy's is managing the trails in India - latest statement says, [results by March - May](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-russia-india-idUSKBN27D1YL) https://www.livemint.com/news/india/pfizer-in-talks-with-govt-to-market-covid-19-vaccine-in-india-11605020656149.html

> Pfizer is in discussion with government to sell its promising covid-19 vaccine in India, and believes its candidate has the potential to be an important part of India’s early vaccine response, a spokesperson for Pfizer India said in a statement to Mint.

> The Pfizer spokesperson added that it expects to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

> Pfizer does not have a distribution pact so far with any company in India. Pfizer also does not have any formal agreement with Covax, the covid-19 vaccine access initiative of Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO).

> The requirement of ultra-low temperature freezers, which is not available in India, is one of the major reasons why the Indian government is not enthused about procuring the vaccine which is being developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.

> The Pfizer spokesperson said that the company has developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring.

> For India, among the early entrants, the outcome of trials of Russia’s Sputnik and University of Oxford’s Covishield vaccines even as early data from Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine efficacy trial spurs sentiment globally.

> The interim efficacy data of both Sputnik and Covidshield is expected over the next one month.

> Government officials have earlier said that India could have a vaccine as early as next month, and hopes are pinned on the efficacy trial being conducted by Covishield’s co-developer Astrazeneca across the world as well as bridging studies by Serum Institute.

> The bridging studies are meant to showcase that the vaccines being produced by the Pune-based firm are the same and produce similar results as the Oxford vaccine.

^ u/v1rk this might interest you, looks like the plan is to rely on Oxford-Astrazeneca data

> Astrazeneca has, as recently as 23 October, said that it anticipates results from the late-stage trials later this year, depending on the rate of infection within the communities where the clinical trials are being conducted.

> The preparations have a rider — they wouldn’t be able to deal in vaccines that require temperatures below -30°C.

> Snowman Logistics Ltd., a cold chain logistics company, operates 31 cold storages across 15 Indian cities at the moment and will boost its capacity to 33 cold storages in 17 cities over the next three months. This translates to 1,20,000 pallets and each pallet can store 6,000 vaccines, Showman chief executive Sunil Nair told Mint.

> ""All our cold storages can technically store up to -30°C and with minor modifications, it can be taken to -40°C as well. However, most vaccine developers are talking of 2-8°C or at most, -18°C. If that is the case, there is good capacity available in India,"" he added.

> “Our company’s capacity utilisation is at 85% now. We expect covid business. When the vaccine arrives, the volume would be good enough to involve private entities,"" Nair hoped.

> So, what happens if India chooses a vaccine that needs storage at -70c?
> Nirmal K. Ganguly, former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said pharma companies developing vaccines are simultaneously developing freezers in other markets. “The freezers would be factored into the price of the vaccine,"" he said and added that in India, organisations such as Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) can mass manufacture such storage if required.

As expected Pfizer will have to handle it's own logistics if it wants to supply vaccines in India/other developing countries . Could still play a major role in large cities & thus free up the other vaccine makers to handle smaller towns and rural areas. Really encouraging to see private sector getting ready in this effort. There was some nice discussion regarding vaccines in the thread yesterday which were extremely informative. Thanks to all who are making the effort to spread proper scientific news. Can anyone tell me what next? Two companies have given some efficiency data. How much longer for emergency approval? I know they are not for India but just asking for US. Are containment zones even being marked anymore? I'm aware of certain buildings with C19+ patients but no banners or stickers are put up, they're just asked not to leave the building. Even the online database and G-maps CZ options don't reflect these.

We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in population behavior over time. **Our model predicts that a small minority of “superspreader” POIs account for a large majority of infections and that restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility.** Is any news outlet or website talking about Covid situation in Bihar along with elections? 1.3 Lakh tests yesterday, and only 678 confirmed positive according to 'official' count.

What is the deal with sealed buildings in Mumbai? The apartment I live in is sealed as per the list on this page
http://stopcoronavirus.mcgm.gov.in/IoM-containment-zone

But entry and exit is not even regulated and there is no ""seal"" as such.

However I have an Exam coming up next week( CA Finals ). Will I be allowed to appear for the exams? The exams supposedly follow MoHFW guidelines I don't frequent the sub much but could anybody give any idea as to how will the international flight travel situation develop in the coming months?

I've got an offer letter from Macquarie Uni Sydney for my master's beginning in Feb'21 but currently you can't travel to Australia. I'm very confused and any help would be appreciated :) As I (and other people) were skeptical about falling TPRs of India, that they are coming from UP and Bihar, I plotted both using [covid19india.org](https://covid19india.org) api. 

 [The graph](https://imgur.com/a/Kztk5BF)  


Observations: 

1. TPR is significantly higher without UP and bihar (around 2%)
2. The shape of the graph is more or less the same only, except for the 2% gap

u/benrogers888 even though you didn't ask for it, I did it anyway XD. Looks like is TRP is dropping even without considering numbers from UP Bihar.   


However, take this curve with a pinch of salt, as I used (cases reported today)/(tests done today)  to calculate TPR. This is not correct as their is some delay due to slowness of RT-PCR. So this curve is not suitable for micro analysis (for example, testing dip during diwali weekend), but good for giving an overall picture of TPR. u/Krab_em can you help me in fixing this? Is there a source where I can get exact TPR? **November 10, 2020 - ICMR testing update**

*While Dolsten didn't specify the storage temperature requirements for a powder-form vaccine, the second-generation version ""could be just for refrigeration,"" providing at least ""one simplification"" over the drugmaker's current version. The first-generation form must be stored frozen at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit, executives have said.* Guys, my parent tested positive and I was wondering if someone here knew about what the Ct values of a test represent about the virus load?

*The test, developed by California-based company Lucira Health, requires a prescription from a health care provider. People under the age of 14 also can’t perform the test on themselves. But with a relatively simple nasal swab, the test can return results in about half an hour, and is projected by the company to cost $50 or less, according to the product’s website. Clinicians can also run the test on their patients, including children under the age of 14, potentially delivering answers during a single visit to a care center or pharmacy, instead of routing a tough-to-collect sample through a lab.* [**Covid: Oxford vaccine shows 'encouraging' immune response in older adults**](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54993652)

*Researchers say the Lancet phase two findings, based on 560 healthy adult volunteers, are ""encouraging""*.

https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/how-deadly-nipah-virus-jumps-from-bats-to-humans-found-912580.html

https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/27/2000429117

> a six-year, multidisciplinary study has revealed how the Nipah virus, which claimed the lives of 17 people in Kerala in 2018, spreads among fruit bats

>According to the research, published recently in the journal PNAS, the Nipah virus (NiV) could circulate among fruit bats, not just in places that have seen human outbreaks, but in any region
where they exist.

>""To prevent outbreaks in humans, we need to know when bats may transmit the virus, and this study provides a deep understanding of Nipah infection patterns in bats,"" study lead author Jonathan Epstein from the EcoHealth Alliance in the US, told PTI

> The scientists said as long as 60 to 70 per cent of the bats in a population have protective antibodies against the virus, there's unlikely to be an outbreak

> ""What this study showed for the first time is that, over time, bats in the wild lose the antibodies which protect them from NiV reinfection,"" Epstein said.

> When a great enough proportion of bats are immune to the virus, there's not much transmission, but when this fraction drops below a threshold the whole colony becomes susceptible, he said

> When that level drops, sometimes as low as 20 per cent, the population is like a pile of dry wood, and as soon as someone throws a match on -- which is to say when NiV is introduced by an infected bat -- you get a bonfire, an outbreak, Epstein explained

> The scientists said outbreaks among bats in Bangladesh seem to occur every two years, adding that it is important to understand this periodicity.


>When there is an outbreak among bats, ""the greatest number of them"" will be shedding the virus in their feces, urine, and other body fluids, and create an opportunity for NiV to jump to people,
Epstein said

>Studies have shown that the virus may spillover to humans via date-palm saps or fruits contaminated by infected bats. ""In an earlier outbreak in Malaysia, pigs amplified the virus. They got infected and generated a lot more virus than bats do. So people were getting infected by a large viral load,"" Epstein said.


>The researchers said people can be protected from exposure to the virus by ""simply preventing date palms from contamination, or by not eating fruits with bat bite marks, and making sure such fruits are not fed to livestock.

>""Fortunately, the Government of India has been starting to pay attention since the Kerala
outbreak, and is also conducting an investigation in bats,” Epstein added. This is vital to determine the spectrum of NiV strains circulating in India and South Asia, know if
there are more-virulent forms of the virus, and to make generalisable predictions on when bats experience outbreaks, Epstein said. He added that even if NiV outbreak among fruit bats in India may follow a similar cyclic pattern,the periodicity may be different.

>The previous guidance suggested that a close contact occurred when a person was within six feet of an infectious individual for 15 consecutive minutes. Now, the CDC is acknowledging that even brief contact can lead to transmission.

> Past calamities show shutting schools for long can reduce children’s earnings throughout their life. India’s pre-existing disparities in resources and learning outcomes mean that some will bear the brunt much more than others

> The tragic suicides of college students because of their inability to take part in online classes have grabbed headlines across the country. An equally profound but silent tragedy has befallen India’s school-children.

> Eight months have passed since most Indian children last went to school, and their loss isn’t just restricted to learning outcomes. Research suggests that for most children, learning less will also mean earning less for an entire lifetime.

> A World Bank research paper published earlier this year suggests that with schools shut, **South Asian children of 2020 will be poorer by an average $5,813 by the time they wrap up work life** . They will earn $319 less per year, costing the region over $800 billion over time. **India will bear more than half of that loss** .

> Another estimate, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) pegs **India’s loss in this century at $12.5 trillion because of students’ lost learning time.**

> This is not without precedent. **If not for the impact of World War II on students’ learning, Austria and Germany could have a 0.8% extra GDP during the 1980s, according to a 2004 research paper.**

> A study from teacher strikes in Argentina in the 1980s found that **three months of missed classes reduced students’ annual earnings by up to 3% when they were in their 30s.**

> Even before the pandemic, the quality of education in South Asia was so poor that 12 years of school meant effective learning of just 6.2 years. This will further drop to 5.5 years, according to the World Bank estimates.

> Just 37% rural children had a smartphone at home when education nonprofit Pratham held its annual survey in 2018. This proportion jumped to 62% during the pandemic, shows Pratham’s latest survey of 52,227 rural households held in September.

> Other factors also impact learning at home. Parental support, for one, makes a great difference. Among the children with well-educated parents, 89% got help in studies at home as schools remained closed. 55% of children with less educated parents received such help. Much of that help came from older siblings.

>  Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that, after conducting the final efficacy analysis in their ongoing Phase 3 study, their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, **met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints**

>  Analysis of the data indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p<0.0001) in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose.

> The first primary objective analysis is based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group

> Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. **The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.**

> There were **10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed** in the trial, with **nine of the cases occurring in the placebo group** and **one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group**

> A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination.

> In addition, the companies announced that the **safety milestone required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been achieved** .

> ...... indicates that a **high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose** , underscoring the power of BNT162 in providing early protection

> The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and **has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 13, 2020** . Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age

> The trial will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years.

That's some serious growth in Infections, adds greater certainty to the vaccine efficacy. New data on protection from severe disease and great efficacy independent of age.

> However, hospitalisations would be much higher if the city opened up completely in the first week of November as against January 1, their studies have projected.

> **Using data available till October 26, the TIFR team says the city would more or less reach ‘herd immunity’ with almost 80% of the slum population and 55% of the non-slum population being exposed to the virus by January 2021.**

> Having studied the percentage of population infected by the virus in three wards across Mumbai, it said the increase in cases about a week or two **after Diwali would appear like a “bump” in comparison to previous peaks.**

> This is because more Mumbaikars have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2-causing Covid-19 now than in August-end when the Ganpati festival ended. “More people are likely to have developed some kind of immunity,'' he said.

> Hospitalisations could jump from **2,300-3,200** a day with the November 1 loosening of restrictions while it would be between **200 and 2,000** a day if it is January 1. The November 1 opening could lead to 20-30 fatalities a day, while the corresponding number for January 1 would be 4-20 a day.

> The TIFR paper also looked at effect of vaccination on Covid's tally and toll. “One scenario we worked out was that if 13.1 lakh people over 60 years of age are given the Covid-19 vaccine if it becomes available in February 2021, assuming that it is 100% effective, it will reduce mortality by over 50% in the six months thereafter,” said Dr Ramprasad Saptharishi from TIFR’s computer science department. Hospitalisations, including critical cases, will reduce by estimated 40% from around 8,840 to 5,340 in the six months following the February vaccination.

> If 29.3 lakh people over 50 years in Greater Mumbai are vaccinated on February 1, number of fatalities thereafter will drop by estimated 64%. “Around 950 deaths as per today's calculations would reduce to 340 in the next 6 months,” said Juneja. Hospitalisations will reduce by an estimated 67% over a six-month period.

> Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday that the national capital is currently facing the third wave of coronavirus. Referring to over 7,000 coronavirus cases that were recorded in Delhi on Friday, Satyendar Jain said the daily new Covid-19 cases in Delhi should drop now.

> ""The first peak of coronavirus cases in Delhi was on June 23. The second wave of coronavirus in Delhi was on September 17. The national capital reported over 7,000 single-day cases and we think, the cases should drop now,"" Satyendar Jain said.

> ""Delhi government has added 500 Covid beds, including 110 ICU beds in the govt hospitals across the national capital. In private hospitals, 685 more beds have been added,"" Satyendar Jain said, adding, ""Delhi govt has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court to address the High Court overturn of our mandate to reserve 80 per cent beds as ICU beds in private hospitals.""

> ""Unlock has happened, it is a festival season also, many people have to go to the market to shop because it is a festival season. Markets are crowded in many places...there are many reasons,"" Satyendar Jain said. He also appealed the Delhiites to wear masks till a vaccine for the coronavirus is developed.

> On Delhi pollution and rising cases of coronavirus in Delhi, Satyendar Jain said pollution is not the cause of Covid-19. ""Pollution is not the cause of Covid, but both are dangerous. The biggest reason for the increase in infections is our behavior. If we do not wear masks, don't follow social distancing, then it is the biggest reason for aa surge,"" he said. https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coronavirus-worsens-in-delhi-gurugram-faridabad-ahead-of-diwali-11605166285854.html

> Delhi’s worsening third wave of the coronavirus outbreak appears to have reached neighbouring Haryana this month. The state reported an 8% surge in infections in the last seven days, led by Gurugram and Faridabad. Both districts fall in the National Capital Region, where the renewed outbreak coincides with increasingly severe pollution levels.

> For instance, Delhi and Haryana alone added 9,263 active cases, and 21% of all new confirmed cases, in the last seven days, data from the Union health ministry on Thursday showed.

> While Delhi’s testing rate is the highest in the country, Haryana’s is on the lower side. With a growing number of virus tests turning positive, the state’s outbreak might worsen if testing is not ramped up soon.

> Several weeks after Chhattisgarh’s massive outbreak slowed down, the state continues to report one of the highest death tolls in the country. More than 2,500 people have died of covid-19 in Chhattisgarh now, and the toll rose 14% in a week

^ this is very interesting, probably the only state with a significant lag between cases and deaths?

> Other states where infections have risen recently—Kerala and West Bengal—reported a sharp decline in active cases. This shows that even though the outbreak is still going strong in these two states, more and more patients have begun to recover, too.

> District-wise data shows Kerala and Chhattisgarh continue to have some of the biggest hotspots in the country. Nine of the 14 districts in Kerala saw confirmed cases jump over 10% within a week, data from howindialives.com shows.

> Among all 308 districts in India with over 5,000 confirmed cases so far, the worst spikes in the past week were reported by Hisar (15%) and Gurugram (14%) in Haryana, and Thrissur (15%) in Kerala. Deaths rose the most in Bilaspur (23%) and Janjgir-Champa (22%) in Chhattisgarh, and Thrissur (21%) in Kerala. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-status-report-from-delhi-maharashtra-gujarat-and-assam-over-covid-19-situation/story-Lxs4pAkpDST4JEZR7JRiQN.html

> Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam have been asked to file affidavits on the steps taken so far by them. All states must prepare for coming months, the apex court said, expressing concerns as several states have reported a resurgence of Covid-19 wave in November.

> A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said, “It is time to introspect where we are lacking. Keep in mind situation is likely to grow grim in the coming months. The situation is likely to grow grim in the coming months. We are of the opinion that all states must be prepared for the coming months. In the last two weeks in November, deaths have increased in Delhi. Similar is the situation in other states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Assam among other states. We need to know the situation as on date.”

> The bench was hearing a suo moto petition on the management of medical care given to Covid-19 patients and the manner of treating bodies, after certain news reports showed bodies lying unattended in the hospital.

> “One of the primary manifestations of Covid-19 has been a severe autoimmune reaction in the later phase of the disease. Among the reasons for rising prevalence in autoimmune disorders in western countries is proposed to be related to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’,” said Mande, who is the co-author of the study ‘The mortality due to Covid-19 in different nations is associated with the demographic character of nations and the prevalence of autoimmunity’, published on MedRxiv..

> Paradoxically, better sanitation leads to poor “immune training” and this hypothesis postulates that exposure to pathogens early in life protects people from allergic diseases later in life. Better hygiene practices could lower a person’s immunity and make him or her susceptible to autoimmune diseases. Improvement in hygiene practices such as better sanitation, availability of safe drinking water, hand washing facilities and others reduces the impact of communicable diseases. On the contrary, such a reduction to exposure to infectious agents might be related to higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders, researchers have noted.

*Note: This seems to be some real high quality work, amazingly detailed and well structured. The authors note the potential limitations and bias in the seropositivity rate, the study however offers great insights into the nature and type of anti-bodies in the sampled population. The paper amazing...oh I already said that ...haha...but it is amazing, so hold tight this is going to be a little long*

----------------------------------
**The Introduction**    

> We examined seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Pune city in India and its implication for protective immunity. 

> Seroprevalence was estimated during **July 20-August 5, 2020 from 1659 randomly selected individuals** recruited from five administrative Pune sub-wards (combined population 366,984).

> Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were estimated and along with correlates of virus neutralisation.

---------------------------------------

**Broad conclusions**

> Declining infection rates in areas with high seropositivity suggest population-level protection and is supported by substantial neutralising activity in asymptomatically infected individuals.

> The heterogeneity in antibody levels and neutralisation capacity indicates the existence of immunological sub-groups of functional interest

> Notably,the incidence of new infections after the sero-sampling period revealed a strong negative association with seropositivity, indicating potential modification of transmission by community immunity

> The instantaneous reproduction number (R) declined following lockdown but remained largely above 1.0(Figure 4 A-E).The reported incidence of COVID-19 after the serosurvey (between Aug 01 and Sep 11)was associated with seroprevalence in each subward (Slope=-0·54, p=0·011), after adjusting for the reported incidence at initiation of serosurvey(Figure 4 F).

*Note: ref. page 25, Figure 4 for the graph. Looks like immunity does dampen the spread - intuitively expected but good to see a study confirm/quantify. One could argue there maybe other factors  ( age,mobility, compliance, testing rates etc ) for which the authors haven't controlled but this wasn't a core focus of the study....an interesting side note essentially.The one factor they did check for was adjusting for infection rates at the start of the sero-survey. The trend still exists.*

> High seroprevalence in the dense urban localities of the study site, despite a protracted and stringent lockdown, provides a realistic account on transmission dynamics crucial for public health policies in LMICs

--------------------------------------------------------

**A little dash of science**

*Note: some of the words may sound complex,have tried to simplify in notes,once de-jargonised it's a little easier to follow*

> While RBD-specific antibody levels expectedly showed broad correlation with neutralisation capacities,30% of individuals showed significant departures from this correlation,again underlining significant immune response heterogeneities.

*Note: RBD is Receptor Binding Domain,very simplified view - spike protein. To be exact it is a region of spike protein that unlocks the cells and allows the virus to infect it. The study found that mostly higher the levels of anti-body that stick to this area of the virus higher is the ability of the immune system to disable the virus.That being said ~30% of the people didn't follow this trend*

> 857 individuals tested positive for the anti-RBD IgG ELISA. The sample weighted seroprevalence was estimated at 51·3% (95%CI 39·9-62·4). 

*Note: IgG is the type of antibody, anti-RBD bodies go and stick to the RBD and disable it .... RBD is the key that unlocks the human cell and enters it, imagine antibodies like plaster of paris that is stuck on the key, so it can no longer open the lock. ELISA is the type of test to identify the anti-bodies*

> From the 857 RBD-IgG positive sera, 697 samples were randomly selected and tested for the ability to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human ACE-2 using a specific ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)

*Note: ELISA based sVNT test is used to see if antibodies can actually neutralise the virus...surrogate because we don't infect humans but cells designed to express the same behaviour as human cells*

------------------------------------------

**Detailed Results**

> 85·1% of the RBD-IgG positive sera were sVNT positive. 

*Note: Basically implies 85% of seropositive individuals also had neutralising anti-bodies. Neutralisation is validated by mixing the serum and a viral suspension and adding this to the cells. The growth of the virus in presence of serum is compared against growth of virus without serum. The ratio of number of infected cells with serum to the number of cells without serum is PRNTxx value. XX denoting the percentage reduction.This is mentioned in the study as sVNT % inhibition [ref. page 27]* 

*Another set of values shared in the study are the dilution values required for PRNT50 i.e how much does the serum need to be diluted to reduce the viral plaque formation by 50%. Larger the number better the serum is at neutralising - this is usually noted as titre value [ref. page 29]*

*Establishing the titre or sVNT inhibition required to call this immunity protective is a little challenging the authors have arbitarily chosen values > 50% inhibition as sVNT high (to be honest this is the common standard) , otherwise sVNT low. Similarly antibody concentration that is 3 times greater than cutoff value of the test is considered as high otherwise low  (this is truly arbitrary ) - you will see this represented by ""RBD IgG S/Co"" or ""S1-IgA S/Co"" on graphs in pages 27,29.*

*RBD or S1 in the name represent which part of the virus the antibody attaches to \| IgG and IgA represent the type of antibody \| S/Co is the ratio of the concentration over cut-off....this the value authors have assumed above (>3 is high & <3 is low)*

> While 57·2% of 18-30years age-group showed≥50% inhibition, this increased to 64% in the 31-50 years category and became 75% in the population above 50 years (p<0.001).

> The high RBD-IgG/low-inhibition group (6.2%) indicates that a significant subpopulation may not be well protected despite having high RBD-IgG. The presence of a large high-inhibition/low RBD-IgG sub-population (23.2%) was also intriguing.

*Note: Basically 6.2% of the people had really high anti-RBD anti-bodies but they didn't prevent the virus from growing in the cells during the sVNT test. Non protective immunity. About 23% of people had low anti-RBD bodies but they still showed high inhibition of viral growth....the authors trace it to anti-spike IgA antibodies. This is the 30% that broke the trend and where Spike IgA anti-bodies come into picture*

> .... neither the proportion or levels of IgA differed significantly between the low RBD-IgG/high inhibition and highRBD-IgG/high-inhibition categories. Therefore, it is plausible that individuals in this categorymay have developed functionally different antibody repertoires ............ 68·4% of RBD-IgG positive individuals were also S1-IgA positive. Asanti-RBD IgA is short-lived in comparison to anti-RBD IgG4, the double-positive population may represent more recent infections. Given the higher surrogate neutralisation activity in the double-positive individuals, it could be speculated that immune protection may wane overtime. 

*Note: The authors feel that IgA and IgG work together to  neutralise the virus.They cautiously highlight the possibility that since IgA wanes before IgG there is a theoretical risk of loss in neutralisation protection*

*People develop a bunch of anti-bodies, this is an alternative to the previous hypothesis to explain the ~30% who broke the trend. They may simply have developed a different proportion or type of the IgG/IgA anti-bodies*

Edit: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0474-z - found a paper in nature that shows IgA bodies lasting as long as IgG. Only a longitudinal study can confirm this.

*Millions of Indians have limited access to clean water, consume unhygienic food, breathe foul air and live in densely packed surroundings*.

*Now, new research by Indian scientists suggests that low hygiene, lack of clean drinking water, and unsanitary conditions may have actually saved many lives from severe Covid-19*.

*In other words, they propose that people living in low and low middle-income countries may have been able to stave off severe forms of the infection because of exposure to various pathogens from childhood, which give them sturdier immunity to Covid-19. Both papers, yet to be peer reviewed, looked at deaths per million of population to compare fatality rates*.

> Around one in four of the 15,000 people tested in the latest serological survey in the capital showed prevalence of antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, the government informed the Delhi high court on Wednesday, indicating that the proportion of people with antibodies has remained largely unchanged from the previous round of the exercise.

> The report also showed that a large proportion (43.5%) of people who had previously been diagnosed with Covid-19 remained sero-negative, a statistic that independent experts said underlined how such surveys were underestimating how many people had been exposed. 

> Researchers caution that absence of antibodies in infected people cannot be conclusive evidence that they are unprotected from the disease.

> The prevalence of the antibodies among those sampled in the fourth round of the sero survey has gone up by minuscule 0.4 percentage points in a month-and-a half – from 25.1% in the first week of September to 25.5% in the third week of October.

> The authors of the study attributed the lack of an increase of sero-prevalence to “fewer infections reported in August” and “disappearing” antibodies.

> In June-end , 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This proportion shot to 29.1% among the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September.

*Study of Ct values in RT-PCR throughout patient admission, Assam, India*

> Retrospective  analyses  of  Ct  values  were  done  from  115 hospitalized  COVID-19  positive  patients  in  different  time  interval.  Patients  were  admitted  to  the hospital  either  by  RAT  or/and  RT-PCR  and  first  RT-PCR  testing  were  made  after  9  days  of incubation  followed  by  testing  in  every  3  days  of  interval  till  negative,  subsequently  release  of  the  patients.

> Threshold cycle (Ct) value of a target gene in RT-PCR based viral molecular diagnosis not only gives information about the presence or absence of a virus, apart it also helps in understanding the dynamics of a virus in due course of infection; however,  clinical importance is limited due to various laboratory complications  

> Many studies on viral dynamics of COVID-19 positive cohorts evidenced that Ct value of a target gene **is inversely proportional to viral loads  irrespective  of  patient’s  conditions** ;  **however  several  technical  problems  need  to  be  considered  from sample collection to RT-PCR testing**

> All the 100 patients  were  kept  for  9  (nine)  days  incubation  followed  by  first  tests  and  subsequently  tests  after  3 (three)  days  of  interval  till  negative.  **The  day  9,  day  of  first  testing  was  taken  as  0  (zero)  day; technically the days of testing are considered as (9+n); where n is 0, 3, 6... days (Figure 1).** 

> The  Ct values  of  RT-PCR  results  were  considered  for  study  and  all  the  **negative  results  were  taken  as  Ct value  of  40  for  the  convenient  of  the  study**

Study data is available from page 8 onwards. They find that N-gene persists longer than ORF gene.

All cause mortality data for Mumbai - 13k to 15k excess deaths on an  base of 50k-52k deaths. Interesting to note: excess deaths started only from April '20 and lasted till August '20. The remaining months had fewer deaths.

Out of the 13k-15k excess deaths, ~9k is officially declared as COVID deaths. So can we conclude that WB has peaked? **November 19, 2020 - ICMR testing update**

> Over 40 per cent people living in Srinagar district have developed COVID-19 antibodies, claims a latest sero-prevalence survey conducted by a government hospital here, the results of which were questioned by the district administration citing small sample size of the study.

> The results of the study conducted by the Government Medical College Srinagar (GMC) show a quantum jump from 3.8 per cent sero-prevalence recorded in a similar study conducted in the city in June, and suggests that a large fraction of the population in the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir may have been infected by the novel coronavirus.

> The sample survey was only 2,400 in a population of around 15 lakh. In order to get an accurate picture, the sample size should have been more,"" an official said.

> Cellular (T-cell) immunity against the virus that causes Covid-19 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, with levels considerably higher in patients with symptoms, a study suggests.

> It is the first study to offer data on T-cell levels six months after infection in people with mild or asymptomatic disease that is likely to represent the majority of infections, the authors say.

> After being tracked for six months, researchers found that every person had detectable T-cell levels, and levels were 50% higher in people who had experienced symptoms at the time of infection.

Additional data streaming in in support of the thesis that immunity is long lasting. This proves T-cell functionality ( in addition to already proven anti-body response).

> The **cut-off** for vaccine effectiveness for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal regulator, **is at 50%**.

> Let us wait for the regulators to examine the data. Any call should be scientifically vetted,” said Dr V K Paul, head of the national expert group for vaccine administration. He, however, said it was unscientific for vaccine manufacturers to put confidential data in public domain. “Such data are meant for consideration of data safety and monitoring board and is highly confidential. **Such data are not meant for public debate as it can create perceptions that may or may not be true,** ” he added.

> Looking to steer clear of the controversy, Indian officials said protocols approved for testing in India are for the two full-shot option and a vaccine with a **62% efficacy, once it clears regulatory scrutiny, is good enough for approval and use.**

> We have **approved a clinical trial protocol only with two full doses.** Besides, **we will give approval after considering global efficacy data along with the data generated from immunogenicity studies that are being conducted by Serum Institute in India** and for the latter, they are using only two full doses. So, **there is no question of considering data for one half dose and one full dose, unless the company makes a fresh application with a new protocol for the same,**” a senior official told TOI.

Edit: There we go, pragmatic , clear and level headed. I don't look too much into the daily case numbers as they have always been underreported by a couple of orders of magnitude, but the death toll in India is really surprising. 125k dead in a pandemic is not that bad for a country as large and densely populated as ours. I know deaths are underreported as well, but you can't hide deaths as easily as you can hide cases. are they really re-opening colleges? was hoping they won't open until january :/ [Impact of reopening in UK on spread of infection in school children ](https://twitter.com/apsmunro/status/1324762913631068161)

Well arguing with people who want everything to open is the same the fact that we could have large amount of doctor deaths, we could put a huge strain on our healthcare that will probably take forever to fix, people won't wanna become doctors  this fact doesn't get to them it's like when you argue didn't say this fact.

Just wanted to ask if this was updated after June or he has no choice but to wait the three weeks? As the new guidelines say you only have to home isolate for two weeks after onset of symptoms. Whatever magic India did in last month or so is working, cases dropped significantly. Time for other countries to follow India. Maharashtra is seriously undertesting man. Maharashtra was 2 weeks ago where Kerala is rn but still Maharashtra has 4-5x the deaths. 

Actually across India testing has dropped by like 25%. [deleted] Is Maharastra's numbers seriously that low today?

Is that a fair summation of events? Most people still don't know why farmers are protesting, And this is 2020, people will not read up on the articles mentioned in the main thread, even if people of reddit do the students of WhatsApp university will not. That is why we need videos for sharing and spreading information. I know YouTube is not a reliable source of information but all the links that I am sharing here are from reputed creators who mention sources. This is a grave issue and media will not cover these so we will have to do it.

THIS NEEDS ATTENTION! It's a shame how BJP led government is stopping them to march towards Delhi by blocking them at Haryana and preventing them to cross through the states. What has been their fucking fault even? There hasn't been any violence as of now in any state/city they've been through, when I'm writing this ( 26th Nov, 10:30pm ) and yet they are being stopped from marching towards the capital. Whatta shame.

Who owns the goddamn highways or state borders? Aren't the citizens of this country allowed to even travel from a state to another.

These practices reminds of the Orwellian regime from his classic book 1984. They have built trenches on Punjab haryana border fucking trenches 
What the fuck was GOI expecting 
A full blown war from.punjab 

Anyhow kudos to people of haryana who are actively filling those up

Some haryana farmera are also razzing their fields to give way to farmers
Salute to all the people fighting Godi media is trying to paint this in bad light. One channel was calling this farmers khalistani while other was saying such protest should not be allowed during pandemic. So peaceful protest is met with atrocities? I am not informed enough to decide whether the bill is good or bad, but I can see clearly how the bjp government is behaving. 

Add to that the bills were passed against rules in Lok Sabha. This government has no respect for democracy. This govt has changed the Jai Kisan slogan to Die Kisan. First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

It's a poem about how Nazis did everything , this is what we are seeing this nOw raise u r voice Very soon there will be a Jallianwala bagh kind of massacre, because General Dyer (Modi) doesn't want to see any protestors (farmers) around him.

It was around this time of the year when the Anti CAA-NRC protests started last year. What we saw later was the - JNU massacre and the Delhi pogrom against Muslims. [Delhi Government rejects the request of Delhi Police seeking to convert nine stadiums into temporary prisons, in view of farmers protest.](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1332227278667800576) >Anand Mangnale on Twitter: ""Fucking hell.

All protests will loose steam eventually, it’s the vote that counts. Punjab voters showed BJP way out. Time for Haryana voters to do that. Will this not affect all farmers across India, why not famers from all over country are protesting ? Bhakts to boycott food to show these anti nationals their place. How long until Arnab and godi media starts calling these farmers terrorists or Khalistanis? I give it a week at most, it may happen even earlier than that. Can we add some links on how we can donate to help provide rations to the protesting kisans? In short a mega corp (eg reliance,Adani, Tata) can dictate how much  the produce goes period , ppl support this may say u can go to APMC to get msp but everyone knows how courrupt they will be and sometimes it will not make sense to take their crops because it will be far away , produce will be rotten by then , transportation cost will be higher than their profits , an APMC can't buy that huge influx of produce , many will ask for bribes . In general a mega corp will dictate everything farmers getting nothing.

Updated 1: now godi/mudi media is telling it's Khalistan movement , NDTV and punjabi channels are covering protests.

Update 2: tractor Jihadi is being thrown out 🤦‍♀️ by pro BJP on few social media (I can't give source) Regardless of the political spectrum you might be on, police digging up roads, setting up barbed wire, lathicharging, using water canon (in winter), setting up cement barricades and blocking roads using lorries, to prevent farmers from marching to Delhi is the most pathetic and deplorable thing the govt has done. 

(Expect this template to follow through, now Indian protestors will be met with barbed wires and dug up roads, they are literally using tactics that forces use against rebellions or terrorists) 

And to the people crying COVID, where did that concern go when you had people shopping in the festivals, when they were polling in Bihar, etc. What happened to COVID then? 

Also, did the centre think that them ramming through this bill during the pandemic, will not get them any opposition, well here you go!! 

Farmers and Punjab showing how its done. (sorta?) out of the loop here. Can anyone explain why the bills are bad from the perspective of a farmer? जय जवान जय किसान! Please watch carefully these videos of Sanghis pretending to be farmers, to show them in bad light.

"Wait for straw, sipper gets longer for Stan Swamy, who has Parkinson’s disease and is in Jail",,Politics," My father has parkinson's and all I can say is that this shit is disgusting What draconian system can't provide a prisoner with a straw for medical reasons? Forget if the prisoner is innocent or not. Not to mention that this is someone who has been fighting for people who has been oppressed by the state. On the one hand we have leaders crying foul for someone like Arnab and on the other hand, the government is arresting academics, activists and killing journalists. I have zero hope Aren't there any rights for prisoners im matters like this? Inhumanity of our system is unbearable. And at the speed at which things are worsening, I shudder to think what future awaits us. Someone couriered a sipper to Taloja jail, and apparently the jail authorities have refused to accept it. We need a  campaign where people  start mailing hundreds or thousands of sippers to the jail. [Source](https://twitter.com/pencilashan/status/1332008035796054016)  At one hand we have Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw who treated Pakistani POWs of 1971 war with utmost respect and dignity. And on the other hand we have current Regime who is violating human rights brazenly. Meanwhile warden, "" subah utho, kasrat Karo, Naha lo, ye Parkinson sab thik ho jyega"".
But seriously though why tf aren't they giving him straw? Are they thinking he'll break out of the prison with that... RIP constitutional values of India...the soul of India is dead But that shit spitter gets bail in no time.

How do people still expect others to trust in justice system? Court should just let him go based on that the jail does not have conditions for humane housing of prisoners. And he's a religious priest mind you, that just stood up for the rights of native tribals. As someone who has seen a close one suffer and die from Parkinsons… my heart shudders when I read about Stan Swamy! Pure evil. Modi has done so fucked things with this country he has ran economy into the ground I don't know how are we letting this happen I feel this is a torture, and a message to others that if you don't bow your head  before us, this is the condition you will face. He has not been proved guilty. He is a human being with some health issues, can't a Jail authority take a decision to provide some basic things. 
We should work on building and empower all kinds of institutions rather than politicians using it. What are you talking about? You AuntyNationals. Our justice system is the best. Didn't you saw how Pornab got quick justice? Fuck the draconian system and government Even kasab was given basic human rights for 1&1/2 years! NIA literally got away with telling the court it has no ~~fucks~~ straws to give. On the very day Chandrachud was pontificating about citizens rights to justify special treatment he meted out to doorknob. A far relative of mine died from Parkinsons. I met him just once before he passed away. I saw him struggle to just chew food. The image of him trying to simply breathe and eat at the same time broke my heart. It was just a glimpse as, at this stage he didn't like people seeing him. The stone-cold cruelty one has to have to see someone struggling from this disease and to deny them basic dignity is unimaginable. Whatever the case may be, this simply something that I will never forget about this government and their cruel influence on our justice system. NIA just told the court that they don't have a straw and a sipper to give it to him.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/do-not-have-a-straw-and-sipper-to-give-stan-swamy-nia-tells-court/article33185647.ece I understood the true degree of social engineering of minds in India after one of my naive colleague started putting status supporting Arnab Goswami. I just told him to not to get carried away by the media narrative. Free Father Swamy, the oldest man accused of terrorism in India! All he did was fight for the poor. Stan Swamy ain’t the puppet arnab goo-swami! India is becoming a cursed country We'll never see all those centrists talking about about rights here or the bhim Koregaon case or for Sanjeev Bhatt. They were coming to out of the woodwork for arnab, they were even here not just making comments making top posts with lot of support. Your Lordship, I wrote you but still ain't callin'  
  
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom  
  
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em  
  
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'  
  
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em  
  
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,  
  
Just to chat,  
  
Truly yours, your biggest fan,  
  
This is Stan India has always been cruel to it's minorities, and people are proud of it ! He should change his name to Arnab Goswami and will immediately get a sipper according to CJI. I'm crying for real. Sad, hope he gets relief soon. Hope news reports this wider.

Just an observation, not justification.

 *  When the goverment has strong leadership, judiciary acts meek
 *  When the goverment has weak leadership, judiciary acts smart

Judiciary and goverment leadership are also humans, laws of power and ego applies.

Now we have strong leadership... So judiciary goes meek and dance to the set tune.

If this news gets attention, the outcome maybe better. Justice is not blind, guess justice reads news and reddit comments.

Indian citizens, judiciary and other institutions are not yet used to democracy, still a lot hierarchical. I hope the situation improves with people satiring and critiquing. We can all learn to have a bit of irreverence to authority and power. Our judiciary systems were always archaic but now they’ve started to become inhuman as well. He’s 83 foe gods sake and they’re fabricating charges which they know won’t stick. This is ducking disgusting and I wish bhakts who have parents can realise what a cancer they are turning our country into. Is he actually proved to be guilty? Naughty boy! LOL Laws are formulated for human beings yrr, and people are not human, how can you even expect that they'll show a bit of human common sense, if that's a word."
Protester at Sydney Cricket Ground during the Australia-India ODI,,Business/Finance," Whats Adani doing in Australia?. i saw some posts about this?.Can anyone explain? This guy thinks indian public can put pressure on SBI😂😂. I have to wait for 3 hours to get a DD to pay my college fee from my account and pay fees for the DD which is handed to be reluctantly. If thanos came to sbi during lunchtime and demanded money or he will blow up the world, sbi employee will still not give a fuck. Wait for some more time, He would be a Bank by then. He don't need SBI Adani wants to build a coal mine in Australia. SBI is giving the loan to Adani.
Most Australians are against this mine.


Then why are they not protesting against their own govt., who sanctioned this project? Building coal mine in 2020 ?? Wtf, I thought we were going carbon free by 2050. That second picture has a great potential to become huge même. Adani will be displacing the natives and the govt is amending land rules to make way for the coal mine.

For me personally, SBI has been amazing. Very fast and cooperative. (PS: I'm not from BIMARU region so maybe that is a factor) Please someone photoshop the placard to Warner's hands in the second picture. Big boy billionaires Adani loan? Lol they are approved by Australian govt to produce coal . Australian have to balance out the investment from China that's why plant is there in the first place. Warner in the background is like ""arre bc meri rozi roti ka sawal hai"" Australians don't know about SBI.

This guy is protesting the Government handing over almost 1 billion aud to Adani to build a coal mine.

Which is just a stupid idea on so many levels, but corruption. Even warner seems to be protesting as well.. How one billionaire could keep three countries hooked on coal for decades: Gautam Adani

My aunt wanted to enroll her kid into whitehatjr and I convinced her against it,"We all know how shitty that scam of a company is, but most parents aren’t aware of it yet.

I visited my aunt yesterday and her kid came to me and told that she is going to be an astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me, where have we all heard about this shit.

Upon further investigation with my aunt and sitting her down and explaining all the shit those people are doing, she was smart enough to get convinced and understand what a scam that company is.

I saved my aunt’s hard earned money and you all can do it too. Speak to your family/friends and make them aware of these shitty companies tricks, and make sure they do not fall for it.

Let’s together expose these scammers.

Edit: Thank you for your support and check r/WhiteHatSr for more info.",Business/Finance," Wow, oh wow!

Good job OP.

We need to discuss tactics and create content against White Hat Jr.

We have to create a mass movement! I have started making my family members aware of this scam a company. I barely participate in family whatsapp group discussions but I've made use of it to spread the word about this scam company. I have just emerged from under that rock. Can you briefly explain what this company is selling (I understand it’s something about coding), and why is it a scam. Please share how you convinced her Power users are real.

This is that guy who everyone calls when their friends and family, relatives need advice on which new phone, laptop, TV or digital tech to get.  
In other domains this may be that person who gets asked about which puja, vrat/fasting and all that nonsense is to be done. 

Meaning one might disagree with the validity of the activity but *Word of Mouth* works and it works to different degrees in different markets/societies.  
In a place like US the efficacy of it might be low but in India this thing has a higher value (for now), whatever it is in statistical terms. Give this man a cookie! Good job my dude. Wait till the aunt talks to her neighbours.

People are not enrolling their kids to these courses for the skills the kid may join, they are enrolling the kids for the bragging rights.

For the next party when the mother can introduce her ""little programmer"" to the family & friends. My friend got a job with those guys , what should I do? >astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me

LOL, hahahahahaha I have convinced over 10 ppl. . hell I even made them go for Udemy courses for Python .. WHJ is BS.. You were just jealous. That kid could have changed the world. If you want to succeed, you need whiteshat jr. I just saw a new ad with Hrithik Roshan Shut  up and take some karma Someone should compose a stinker of a Whatsapp forward we can spam to our family groups. Atleast there's one thing we can learn from the BJP IT Cell. It works. Well done.  Parents would go to any lengths to give their child a ""competitive"" edge over others. That's what whitehat jr's selling on. That is what coaching sells on too. It's not developing interest in coding, that's just a side benefit. If parents understand that comparison damages kids a lot, the nation would be doing a lot better. Making them understand that is difficult but you've done that. So, well done again. I am also 14 and I wanted to learn programming some time, my dad and mom were seeing all theses ads and wanted me to do whitehat, took the free class where they just taught me how to make a basic game and that too without any real programing lol. Anyways at that time i wasn't interested in all these kiddish games so I pulled out and I'm doing free online courses for python. Hi. Can we get school associations to write a notice citing their stance on these orgs? I can coordinate. Is there anything the gullible parents who thought Wolf Gupta and Ryan Venkat are really working for Google and they landed crores in salary do? Can they launch a class action law suit against this company in India? 

If they did this the US, they would have been in a deep trouble already. damn! Good job! Can someone explain this WhitehatJr stuff?? Seeing a lot of it lately and don't really know what's going on. Pls help. Thanks for saving a soul. You are on a mission, Don't stop :) Send her to the youtube channel of ""Sentdex"". He has hundreds of videos of Python and he starts from the very basics. 

If your cousin doesn't understand anything, tell her to try again in a decade. Same here even my cousin brother wanted to learn coding so my aunt decided to join him in Byju's but I convinced them not to Thanks to you she is convinced ....
These shit heads should stop knowing so much resistance is happening. Thanks to the guy fighting against them. Plus thanks for being a light of hope too. Lol their coding is drag and drop blocks when asked when hard code would be taught they said later no joke they said later anyway after fighting with my parents my sister is no longer doing that LOL, if her kid doesn't turn out to be the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezoz, then she's gonna blame you for the rest of her life.

Just Indian mom things. I have found the most popular way to convince people, It's free. You don't have to pay for something that's available on the internet. Not much argument is made after that. What happened to our indian parents?  How did their obsession change from doctor/engineer to computer programmer/app developer. Is this the new obsession of the new  millennial parents. 🤦‍♂️ Somewhere around 9-11 months ago, one of my distant relatives called me to check whether he should enrol his kid. That was the first time I heard about WHJ and after listening to the concept I got a feeling that this was less related to any genuine learning experience for a kid but more related emptying pockets of anxious parents. To the best of my judgement I requested him to stay away from this and rather let the kid spend some time playing physically instead. 

Props to the parent who sought advice from someone in academia/ related field. Most others don't. So it's upto us to proactively inform them. Well done, OP! Programming is an intellectual exercises.

Teaching syntax is trivial. You can help her by asking to buy ""Raspberry Pi"" and it will cost only 5000-7000 , to have a open source computer where kid can not only learn programming but also physical computing and that too free, the"" Magpi"" magazine teaches   tutorials and that too with free digital version. That's nice, at the same time, I would recommend an alternate source to your niece to learn programming from as well. 

False advertisement and censoring criticism are not entirely new and most companies do it at least to some degree. A company tends to do it in its initial stage than later. Remember how you exaggerated some of your skills and achievements on your CV the first time you applied for a job? I get the hate for whitehatjr but I would really like to know how good their programming courses are, from an objective perspective. I know a kid called Chintu, he's enrolled with white hat jr he's pretty smart I'd say. good job !! The way it is going on, I think Karan Bajaj’s gonna end up like Nirav Modi Good job OP.

Recently my Didi’s kids and other cousins asked me about it. I said no and shared them “real” sites like khanacademy, coursera and more. 

Even bought some paid iPad apps for them. They are loving it. 

And no distractions with ads or scammers calling them with discounts. Let's do it let's make a petition to ban white hat jr.  guys what do you say? good job Congratulations! Noice 
You saved a life to be honest U did a great job bud. Salute All hero's don't wear capes. Thanks for this man. astronaut programmer, WTF!! Good job! This bloody WhatsApp , in every week , I have to break several myths of those god damn Nuskhe .. like recently, there’s a message claiming to be cure of Cronavirus by just doing steam bath .. don’t know why , people search on Google .. read some news to get gist of it . Great job man.

I think you should add the points/arguments that you used to convince her in the post above so that we can have an example. I am curious about how people are willing to pay that much amount ? I feel sad for my friend who was hired by this scampany, he had no other choice , as he had lot of financial problems. Way to go OP!!! Good one! Need more people like you I'm proud of you Thank fucking God! Good Not all heroes wear capes Good job boiiiii 🙌 Hope there is an alternative learning method you could recommend the kid though?

IMO her dream > taking down some construction of capitalism that's just another hydra head at the end of the day. Massive respect Ek ko to bacha liya, par iss desh me ""stubborn parents in a rat race with the society"" ki koi kami nai hai dude.

Apne logon ko bacha lo bas.

Byjus aur white hat aur alag alag chutiyappe aate rahenge aur prosper krte rhenge.

Bhai IIT ke naam pe maa baap apna ghar bech dete hain, dimag to ghutno me rehta hai unka. Wtf is an astronaut programmer? This is the reason it is said “Not all hero’s wear capes” Is byju also in the same category as whitehat? Can someone explain what the controversy is behind WhiteHat Jr? This is the way More power to you! That's nice of you to do that Well done, Op. My aunt was going to enroll my cousin too. I convinced her against it and thankfully, my tweets had already made an impression in her mind that there was something wrong with the company. I convinced her to let me teach my cousin and so far, it's going great. 😁 Embrace yourself op .....

A defamation case coming right up for you lol Good job OP. For everyone intrested check out r/whiteHatSr  
You'll find everything you need to convince someone Why is r/India suddenly ganging up on whitehatjr? This is the third or fourth post with 2000+ upvotes and hundred+ comments 

I have nothing for or against whitehatjr, but just wondering. The scam lies only in the false/exaggerated advertisements right? What they've done to suppress bad reviews is highly unethical and I would like to believe it's illegal too but does that make it a scam?  At the end of the day they do provide coding classes in exchange for money so only their ""promises"" are false.   
  
That being said there's probably tonnes of better resources out there for kids to learn (if they want to) so this company shouldnt exist in the first place. What is astronaut programmer Nice job OOTL

What's Whitehat Jr.?

EDIT: An online computer tutorial? Why is it a scam. Kids should know how to code if they want to learn. Get a lawyer OP. W. Excellent. I passed on a few links shared by Pradeep with my school group. Stopped two of my friends from registering their kids. Pradeep is doing God's work!  I did that as well like two months ago... My aunt was keen on making get kid join WhiteHatJr and Byjus. Granted they have fuck all money, I still convinced them to not join the course What WhiteHatJr did is called topee pahanana (to make a fool of someone)! Go you Their whole marketing / sales / approach to coding is terrible. Yet, I have both my daughters enrolled in their course. They enjoy themselves, they like the teachers and have a lot of fun coding. 
Weird situation I know - but I do think that they have created a decent idea but then bludgeoned it with this whole hype of being the next tech founder rather than just keep it simple - kids enjoy activities and keep it at that level.

Edit: For what it's worth - I also find their classes very reasonably priced. Why exactly is it a bad company? I am a student of whitehat jr. in age of 14 inaware of the shits of this company and i can confirmed it actual taught me to code. My parents didnt buy any tech or any special courses etc so we basicaly dodged all that shit. so apart the scams im telling you this course is actually helpful to me and will probably help your child. just avoid any extra purchasing"
The BJP is making Rohingyas an issue in Hyderabad Municipal Elections,"While it is true that few Rohingyas do live in a few refugee camps in the city, why are refugees of a particular community being targeted? BJP seemed very concerned about refugees, wanting to bring in the CAA to help them, but show their hypocrisy when the refugees are Rohingyas. Of course, they're not citizens, can't vote or get any benefits, they're here just for safety till things get better in their home country, but you still want to drive them out because they're not of the religion you like? What do the pro CAA people have to say regarding this?",Politics," BJP's presence isn't good for a place like Hyderabad. They're the easiest target. No one to stand up for them. Muslims. Easy to brand anyone opposing BJP tactics as anti national. Floods, garbage, rampant corruption in road contracts all are irrelevant. 
Only rohingya relevant. And yet they might win. Says a lot about the intellect of the average voter in India BJP knows how to pander to their audience. CAA is not about helping refugees. It's about bringing in more Hindus and putting the Muslims in detention camps.

The clearest evidence of this is that the govt calls the Pakistani ahmadiyya a persecuted minority and yet refuses them the benefits of CAA."
Trenches dug upto several feet on national Highway to stop Farmers going to delhi. This is Indian government against peaceful protests for you.,,Policy/Economy," Like Ravish Kumar said, ""they have erased the difference between covid19 and farmers"" (same trenches were dug during the lockdown to curb covid19) [removed] So govt is vandalizing govt property They have come prepared..they are in huge numbers. Will fill it back in no time. they are farmers! Shameful Am still amazed people cant see what government is doing and still voting them in power!!! Its absolutely fucking bonkers... and these roads will never be made properly... SMH it took government 50 years to probably build these roads and this government is destroying the property..... Anpahd  jhahil chutiya nandan modi hai toh sab mumkim hai. ""National Highway""?? This is crazy Can I have the source please? Source ? Fuck Modi government and fuck everyone who support him. Fuck every main news paper and channel not showing the ground reality of farmers marching toward Delhi. If this was a true democracy, farmers have every right to protest in New Delhi. Modi thought Punjab was Bihar or UP, we are born different. Don't fuck with Punjab or the farmers. This will be the end of Modi era. i don't get it though. If you are in power and you choose not to listen to people, then why are you in power? Cowards are doing all this to avoid gatherings and protests in Delhi. International news will pick it up and hamper the supreme loser's fucking image no.. Every word of gormint aunty is golden. Reread the whole thing she said. 

But remember she was talking about Pakistan, not about Indian Govt. The fellow who has the stick owns the buffalo.

We do not deserve good roads. So someone dug them up, to keep someone's pride intact. He may not have said them to do it, but they did it anyway. If you are in power and you can't respect farmers what can you do. BJP is tripping on power so hard. They just can not see us criticising the government For those who are asking for source

Small price to pay for being in khatra /s Oh they're so scared aight is there a neutral candidate this coming election?  We have a Donald Trump and Joe Biden case over here. Unpopular opinion: I think the government is probably doing the right thing here.

The reason I say so is that these protest have a very high probability of turning violent (bus burning and similar stuff). If that ends up happening we will still blame the government of not taking enough action even when they were aware of the possibility.

The government is in a tight spot here and erring on the side of caution seems to be the correct approach. India has always been authoritarian, and will always remain authoritarian. Are constitution makers couldn't even wait for first election to make constitution useless.

Any way the only people who will ever protest for less market freedom are communists and unions(foot soldiers of communists). [removed]"

This is truly fucked up. The ""fair"" judicial system is one of the most unequal things in this country. Is it going to be a non-stop party?

Ah, not that kind of party. Never mind. It's already a one party state  The Supreme Court recently granted bail to journalist Arnab Goswami, who was arrested in November last year for his alleged debt to a decorator who had left a suicide note blaming him, among others, for his fatal distress. ""If we as a constitutional court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?"" a judge said.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=ee135a)* First past the post is a very unrepresentative system. It tends towards a two party power structure (UK, Canada, Australia, USA)

Once you add in regional parties (based off of language, tradition, religion) you end up with seats taken away (eg. SNP in Scotland, Quebecois parties in Canada, in India it's dozens - AITC, DMK, AIMIM) 

This allows a ruling party to dominate the seats with low low voting percentage, eg. India 37% of the vote, 56% of the seats, UK 43% of the vote, 56% of the seats. 

With no effective opposition (INC look pretty ineffective from my viewpoint) the BJP may well grow stronger with marginal or even very little gains in percentage vote increases. 

India isn't a one party state, but the BJP can act like it with this voting system as they dominate a fractured parliament, with regional opposition (with their own goals) and an ineffective national opposition. Did anyone see Rahul Gandhi anywhere? More than Modi, I’m starting to hate RaGa even more. This “silver spoon” boy doesn’t do what’s required from an opposition, then he’ll jump into elections without required grass work only to weaken the regional opposition party in various states."

When they ask whether you support BJP or you are anti-national, tell them you are a patriot.",Politics," *""The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility, but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war.""*  - **Sydney J.

"Sex workers in #Maharashtra will be given financial aid of Rs 5,000 per month from Oct to Dec. Those sex workers who have school-going children will be provided additional Rs 2,500. Nearly 31,000 beneficiaries have been identified: State Women & Child Development Ministry. (ANI)",,Policy/Economy," Good initiative. If govt recognizes this work (industry really), then they should legalize it with right kind of paperwork, taxation and STD testing standards. Obviously most get into selling body business by force and not by will. Legal framework for sex trade will only help make more legit when it comes to trades. Progressive AF although I wish the aid was a bit more. Great step towards a fairer world. Given the history of Indian scams, hope its not politicians wives the target of such financial aids. I hope the money stays with the sex workers, and this entire exercise doesn’t end up as a gofundme for pimps. 31,000 number is far from reality. These numbers may be from urban centres like Mumbai and Pune. But it is good initiative, baby steps but positive. good on the government. If they could just make their working conditions better it would really help them like easy reporting of violence, continuous testing. I think many are still forced into this so the long term solution as always is a good education system and accessibility to all. I hope that the actual people are really benefited by that That's such a good step forward. Somedays this reddit and our country is filled with horrible news but this is really nice to hear, I hope these women definitely get these benefits not just on paper but in real life and that other states follow suit as well.

Farmers march: Thousands headed to Delhi today amid heavy police deployment,,Politics," Modi doubled their incomes, so they going to Delhi to collect their monies?

Divide and rule, that is what RSS/BJP knows. This country has so many victims,and they still cannot seem to get under one roof. - Police said they will not allow the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws to enter Delhi if they reach the borders of the national capital.

- Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who visited the bordering areas, said “Due to Covid-19 guidelines have been issued in which political gathering is not permitted here and for this, their (the farmers’) request was rejected. If they still make an attempt, we have deployed personnel at the borders to not let them enter the national capital. We are also in contact with Punjab and Haryana Police.”

- Traffic movement is likely to be disrupted in the border areas. The traffic was also closed from Bahadurgarh towards Delhi on Thursday evening, officials said.

- Delhi Metro services from neighbouring cities to the national capital will remain suspended on Friday in view of the ‘’Delhi chalo’’ protest march. However, metro services will be available from Delhi towards the NCR sections.

- Five sand-laden trucks and three water cannons have also been stationed at the Singhu Border to stop tractors being driven by the protesters, news agency PTI reported. Officials have stated that drones have been deployed to keep a tight vigil to maintain law and order.

- Areas affected by the police deployment include - NH-24, DND, Chilla Border, Tigri border, Bahadurgarh border, Faridabad border, Kalindi Kunj border and Singhu border.

- Authorities in Haryana have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of the protesters.

- Reports of altercation surfaced from Ambala on Thursday where barricades erected by the police on an overbridge on the Ghaggar river were thrown into the river by the farmers after facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. The police, on loudspeaker, asked farmers on the Punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. As smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter Haryana around noon.

- In political development, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who criticised the Haryana Police’s action.

- Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab’s 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted.

Kissing scene in a temple- Insult to Hindutva, love jihad

not surprised, really I hate this.

What's happening to our country?

Why are these people being so weird? Good.. Remove these romance and sex from movies and series and bring back the old fashioned dance scenes! Keep some of our idiotic traditions alive and kill anything different! 

""One step forward and two step back"" should be an Indian National motto. Is this the temple kissing thingy from a series that’s gaining traction lately ? If so, I’m waiting when they’ll abolish the following temple for their sexual sculptures:

Khajuraho Temples Madhya Pradesh, 
Sun Temple: Konark, Orissa,
Virupaksha Temple Hampi, Karnataka,
Jain Temple  Ranakpur Rajasthan, 
Sun Temple, Modhera Gujarat, 
Sathyamurthi Perumal Temple Tamil Nadu,
Lingaraj Temple, Bhubaneshwar, Orissa Epic. 
This government only thrives on love jihad propaganda and hate. Forget about GDP just focus on dividing people instead. Worked for the British and working for RSS meanwhile marital rape is legal, priorites man, priorities Another distraction for the masses. 

Politics of polarisation is the worst. But from a politician point of view it has the highest effort to impact ratio. All this government does is pick up controversial issues for outrage so that actual problems that they have created don't come under citizens' purview. Ab kare to kare kya, 

bolein to bolein kya? Looks like the right is easily aroused. That makes them angry. I think that's funny. Especially the part where they all agree to be angry. Which means they are all aroused as a group. LOL. It’s a very nice show. Must watch. This is something I don't understand. If you have a problem with some content, don't fucking watch it. Why tf do these people have to create such a fuss about it? Same applies for any content across any medium.

India-destroying artistic freedom since 1947. #Source: [smishdesigns](https://mobile.twitter.com/smishdesigns/status/1331783626296475648) so what's the context? As someone who has not watched indian media in long time i have no idea, are they french kissing? I always thought Hinduisim was a liberal religion(or way of life as everyone says) when compared to the abrahamic religions which conveyed conservative ideologies. But these days bhakths are getting offended for anything and everything. Had the intimacy scene been in any ruin there would have been no opposition but the temple depicted there is alive with active devotees.

There are some institutions with sanctity and own rules like Schools, Research Labs, Business Centers and so on. You got to follow their rules. And temple too is one of them.

If kissing was to be done anywhere and everywhere, why do you want pubs, resorts, spas, beach and hotels then?

Depicting Khajuraho sculptures and giving excuse for scene is just like masturbating in front of teacher in whole class because there's a chapter in syllabus : ""Reproduction in Humans.""

Sex is a part of culture and not the culture as a whole. Sculptures meant keep aside your lust and enter the place with calm mind. We respect SEXUALITY and NOT LUST.

If you are so self-obsessed (because even minors visit temples) and cannot have self-control for a few minutes then the problem lies in you. I got notification for this and I want to ask why am I here? Seriously whatever with this fight over can anyone fill me up with this? Q. Stree / patni / premika  kya hoti hai?

They r just finding reasons to turn heads the other way lmao and they just got one more For those wondering about the context : This is from a series which is based on the book A suitable Boy - Vikram Seth. 

The novel follows the story of four families over a period of 18 months, and centres on Mrs. Mehra's efforts to arrange the marriage of her younger daughter, Lata, to a ""suitable boy"". Lata is a 19-year-old university student who refuses to be influenced by her domineering mother or opinionated brother. 
In the meantime Lata is approached several times by a boy her own age and after a few meetings feels she has already fallen in love with him. She learns his name is Kabir Durrani and is distressed when she realises he is Muslim as her Hindu family would never allow her to marry a Muslim man. When her early morning meetings with Kabir are discovered she tries to run away with Kabir, who refuses. Ultimately she gives up on kabir and marries a Hindu. 
So during one of their morning meets Kabir and Lata kiss each other in an old Fort once. People are offended coz this scene apparently promotes Love Jihad. Dare to show these type of scenes in mosques, I challenge! ᕙ (° ~͜ʖ~ °) ᕗ Masjid mein bhi kissing ,sex scene dikhao jahan ladka hindu ho or ladki muslim ,for dekhna foe kahan jayenge. What happened, can someone explain? Are bhakts making ruckus about it or have some scenes actually been deleted?

Edit: Not sure why somebody downvoted it. I genuinely want to understand what’s the situation. Time to get a VPN guys. This uproar made me see the movie ans recommend it to a bunch. Mira Nair is a great director. Bhakts come across more and more as having an inferiority complex to Muslim guys.

I’d wager they subconsciously think themselves as not equal or good enough and thus we have them triggered at stuff like this. [removed] I'm new to this. Can someone please explain what this post is all about? Can anyone explain this please I read this book when I was in college... in 1997. I guess bhakt brigade don't read books and only figured out this storyline now. Ye kya hai? ""The object of Section 295-A is to punish deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulating its religion or the religious beliefs.""

Section 295A needs to go else more ""religious people's feeling might hurt"" What is the name of the film Democracy is a slow process any young democracy has these issues I wanna know if the person who filed the complaint is a Netflix subscriber or not je suis Charlie Of course that's what our MPs are doing, there not much else that needs their attention.

"IIT-R professor calls student 'soft' for not attending class due to father's death, draws social media ire",,Non-Political," Few years ago a professor at one of the NIT drove a student to death. Why? Attendance shortage due to some shit in his family that the professor knew very well about. The guy quit and ended himself.

A student's life in India is so cheap... if that professor stays then he will try to make this student's college life hell. That's exactly a scene from 3 idiots and still a grim reality in many colleges I think it's fair to call the professor an asshole. Reminds of the time when I was a student at IISc and had lost my grandfather before a very important exam. My PhD advisors didn't offer a single word of condolence when I told them, never empathized with my mental state, and pretended as though these are just ""regular life events"" that one must get through. 

I tell you, sometimes people in academia do not show an ounce of humanity. They can be ruthless. Everyone sack that asshole professor. A lot of profs are  like that. Anything thry say goes,  and agar offend ho gaye,  to semester to bas gaya.  They may have been good academician,  but not all are not good teachers. India mein gand marate reho chahe kuch bhi ho jaye. Baap mar jaye, kisi ka accident ho jaye par gand marate raho. Daya khatam ho chuka hai. Work hard to get into IIT and then get called 'soft'.... What an insensitive comment to make, put yourself in other person's shoes and say what you say. And maybe the professor is actually mentally ""strong"" but he is wrong in assuming that everyone is like him.      
Anyway get some perspective prof, your subject isn't that important. Not more than a parent. Wtf > the teacher wrote a mail saying he never intended any wrong

yeah right, ~~he is only sorry because this blew up~~ his statement was more like an excuse.. > Professor Patit Kundu

First name checks out. Oh yeah, the professors in these so-called ""Institutes of national importance"" have this entitled holier than thou attitude and you can't even touch them since many of them don't have student councils too. I'll give an example from my college(not IIT but NIT), where there was a kid who got in using the disability quota and was a bit weak in his academics. One of the professors bullied him which finally resulted in the poor kid committing suicide late down the year. And nothing happened to the professor too and he's still the HOD. Fuck that asshole and fuck this asshole. The education system is in need of a severe overhaul, the professors in these govt. institutes have become these spoiled brats who use any excuse they can to make the lives of students hell. Last year I couldn't attend a lot of classes because of my father's death. Every other teacher understood the situation and increased my attendance so I could sit in their exam, but this one prof wouldn't. I have to give a re-exam this year for the subject. The worst part is that the subject was one of those easy ones that are not part of your core curriculum. Life inside IIT is good is the biggest lie my teachers told me. It gets so tiring between constant assignments, quizzes, project, project vivas, lab, lab vivas that the best part of my day these days is just sleeping. I am so tired😩 I am a  IIT Roorkee 4th year student. The sadest part of the whole student is that the professor responsible is unable to understand the true situation and show sympathy to the student. Here is the response e-mail send by the professor after the video going viral. [response of the professor](https://www.imgurupload.com/uploads/20201126/2a5ca2771f515a8d01954af262d3a48e6b1c8504.jpg) Having graduated from IITR, it is a horrible institute. I and my friends were made to take an exam from the hospital because I had chicken pox and other guys were undergoing a pain medication for kidney stones. Naturally I flunked. There are many many more horror stories but IITR is a gandiya institute. India's best and finest educational institutes they say. Soft professor worried about student attendance >His mail stated, ""Instead of doing all these (recording and making it viral through your friends), you could have simply mailed me after the class to apologize to Vedanta for not showing apathy

What does he think the word apathy means? I might be wrong, but I feel like the professor wouldn't have acted like this if the student was female. Because then, being soft with a parent's demise would've been ok? 

Men too can have mental health issues. Unfortunately, society doesn't see it that way. He should be sued for harassment and defamation. I was a student of this professor , he threatened me with not letting me write my exams and asked me to leave the class because I didn't attend a few previous classes because of a foot injury. It was early in the semester and I would have easily attended the required number of classes to give my exams. Disheartening to see that this is still a thing that's happening. I lost my father when I was 17, in Class 12th. One of my teachers called me ""overly emotional"" and said I was ""running away from my responsibilities"" when I refused to participate in a school competition. My professor told me to take as much time I need and to take care of my family. as a chemical engineer who graduated from IIT roorkee- slap a fine on this professor please BC I don't think with what I earn and my future prospects that I can ever go out of India to live there. But I promise I will be a really good open minded uncle and will marry a hot aunty who is understanding and  money will be our least matter of concern. I hope there are other good bunch of potential uncles out there who plan on staying in this country to make it atleast bearable. A friend of mine was doing her JRF in IIT Kharagpur. This professor made her life hell, she never received her stipend while she was there(her family is somehow making the ends meet). Finally she had to quit! And no one spoke against that professor, he is notorious for this in the entire department and does the same to whoever he feels like! I have heard countless such incidents of asshole profs in my college. Sucide, oppression case, racism, sexism everything. Profs literally speak whatever nonsense they want in front of students. And it's really sad students don't really complain against these profs. These profs should not be allowed anywhere near IITs and yet many of them hold substantial power in their department. Another simp trying to look macho IITs are extremely overrated retarded places. Avoid at all costs."

Just take loni- ghaziabad road and you should end up near ambala cantt ( use map) and even private buses are following the same route I drove from Delhi to Punjab last night. Reaching Sonepat was the most the most challenging part, taking about 5 hours which normally takes 1. The delhi haryana border on the hoghway was blocked and we had to circumvent it by taking an excessively long detour. Next up there were road blocks at Panipat and Karnal and we had to leave the highway and circumvent them using village roads. At the end a journey of 4 hours took us about 10. Talking to protesting farmers, we came to know there are more protesters coming in from punjab side so police might block some other sections as well. As for traffic, there was none. So would I recommend? No. Is is possible to travel? Yes, if you have your own car and willing to take detours. Go to saharanpur and then to Chandigarh. Good enough roads They just announced that delhi police will let farners protest peacefully...maybe now police will unblock roads. Man that would really suck. not attending your own wedding haha.

It is in Haryana but Delhi is a stone throw away. Practically no internet there. JIO, Airtel, Vodaphone, nothing works. I am surprised about the high percentage in Himachal Pradesh. One would think the opposite considering its majorly hilly state. No surprise seeing Delhi with the highest...but WB and its neighbouring states seem very very underdeveloped.

Experience with WhithatJR,"Just  talking  about my experience with them as someone who has taught coding  (web dev to be specific) to kids and adults.  So I decided to apply to  be  a teacher for fun, because it was lockdown and I wasn't doing much  also  since I have 6-7 years of teaching experience .  First off there  aren't any requirements to be a teacher except to have a broadband  connection (not wifi).  The introductory call was pretty boring and  disorganized. First we had to make an account on [code.org](https://code.org/).  Its a million dollar company and they can't invest in their own  curriculum and material. That's when I knew it was a joke and decided to  basically not even go through it.  The entire introductory call  consisted of dragging and dropping blocks. LOL.

When  I asked about their pay, the woman said you can make upto 30,000  rupees. This again was a red flag,  what did she mean ""you can..."". It's  either you do or you don't.

They  called me repeatedly and wanted me to attend other sessions. I blocked  their number because I never intended to work for exploiters.

Their  whole advertising nonsense is out into the light and I'm glad. I'm sick  of these money mongers exploiting people and basically making real  educators look bad.  Yes you can learn online free and you can even pay  someone to teach you. But their whole system is deceptive and based on  fooling people to GRAB as many paid users as they can and then RUN. Just  like OYO and other MLM schemes/companies AKA startups

This  summer, whitehat""joke"" wasn't the only company willing to exploit  teachers and parents. Because of my experience teaching online I  interviewed with many more companies ( German company wanting to expand  in China, a Canadian company, and one in the UK trying to start in  India) I did not intend on working for them because they weren't paying  teachers well (ofcourse..) and their whole system was based on getting  as many paying customers while overworking teachers.  One of them asked  me how to explain ""algorithm"" to a 8 year old. Which to me was very dumb  because at 8 they're learning basic scratch and their language  acquisition skills aren't developed enough to even spell algorithm.

BTW  Byjus uses adobe and that's all there is to their whiteboard  animations.  They're also very aggressive with marketing and don't  really treat employees well.

Throwaway account but real experiences.

Their offer was also peanuts as a base amount for 5 hours a day of demo classes + upto 80k a month in incentives if you get enough parents on board.

I want to ask indians about the treatment of women in india and their opinions on it,"I was  a little afraid to post this because you guys are indians and might take offense to my post but I went ahead to post it because I want to hear your side.

I say almost because societally and in some rules that still exist, we're not given equal respect or rights but this goes two ways- meaning the same is true for men too. Anyway, I come from a very traditional family who moved from india. And my entire life has been about me being objectified and treated like a property by them in the name of the Indian culture and traditions and threatened and physically abused if I don't comply.

They are christians and they still believe in dowry and arranged marriage (meaning during a marriage that is arranged by parents of both sides, the girl's family has to ""give"" a huge load of gold to the marriage and say ""hey, this is how much she's worth, take her and this is often a few $10,000"". They want the girl to do ALL the household chores. I remember days when my dad would end work earlier than my mom or be on leave and all he would do is lay on the couch or use his phone/ computer and not help out at all. Like why can't men help out too? No one likes doing it but it needs to be done! On the end, my mother wakes up at 5am daily to cook for the family while my dad gets up much much later. My mom is a community nurse and her job involves visiting patients from home to home and she is tired after work because she is getting old and traveling is tiring. Meanwhile, my dad works in a remote company with a chair to sit all day but he can choose to stand too. Considering all that, my dad does almost nothing at home and my mom exhausts herself 4x more than my dad. She thinks she is doing it for duty and he thinks he doesn't need to help because he is not obliged to.

I couldn't take all that was happening in my house anymore. Everytime I opened my mouth to say anything, my dad and brother would dismiss me and say my opinion is not valid, what they were really saying is I'm a girl and because of that I don't know anything, even though I did much better than my brother in school and I do read a lot and pursue knowledge a lot. Had they listened to me for example, they could have saved $8000 during home renovations. What triggered me to move out of my home was all that and forcing me to study and do things I do not want to and pressuring me to get an arranged marriage. I moved so I can study what I really want- web development and I have an internship now. 

Despite all that, my family still sees me as a failure and a disgrace. They don't care about my academic achievements or career. They even forced me to go to the cheapest university in the country and not let me go to a good university overseas (which i initially wanted). Meanwhile, they are paying as much as university would cost to my brother in polytechnic- it is an alternative path to study before university and an option that I never had. Little do they know, that their ""perfect"" son scammed them of $2000 by printing out a fake form pretending like it was from the school saying he has to go on a compulsory school trip to china for 1 month or he would lose out on credits and it would cost that much. It was a trip with his friends. He also smokes, drinks and does drugs- none of which I judge or condemn but I am mentioning because my parents would flip if they find out I did that. I cut him out of my life after he r*ped his gf (that was the final straw) and has no idea what consent is after he told me how he tried to kiss girls at the bar and they flinched and I told him he cant do that he needs consent and he dismissed me- we argued about it then I realised his view is as distorted and messed up as theirs and I would be better off without him

Today, I work and cook almost everyday- which to me is a huge thing and takes a lot of effort and energy. I know this because I went through a phase of depression where I was unable to do anything but I picked myself up again and I see that as an accomplishment now and progress towards my long term goals. I dont understand how traditional people like my parents and people who don't respect women like my brother can look down on women so much. If my brother was living alone, he would not be able to balance career with housekeeping and cooking as making time for friends (this last one I need to work on more), he would be spending more than me ordering food and not keeping the house tidy. They take us for granted and look down on us when we can do more than them and I dont mean this in a condescending or looking down on only all men way- ofc women like my mom encourage this kind of thinking as well- but rather we have different strengths and it is foolish to look down on women and suppress them when we can do so much. I'm not sure if I made sense here...what are your thoughts on this...what is this worshipping of men and treating women like less than men?",AskIndia," TL:DR

I think in general this has to do with the culture, which will take more time to evolve.

Some places it's evolving quicker than others, when more women become independent,  I think we'll be able to see more change. Yeah well patriarchal society and engrained misogyny. What can one do. It is changing fast. Here's to hope your doing good now."

"Do not have a straw and sipper to give Stan Swamy, NIA tells court",,Politics," TLDR: 83 Year Old Stan Swamy was arrested on Charges of Sedition. In Jail, he asked for a Straw and Sipper to drink water as he has Parkinson’s and is unable to hold a glass for drinking. 

Had to approach Court for the same request and Court gave Prosecution 20 Days to decide. 20th Day, NIA replied they don’t have a Straw and Sipper. Modi hai to mumkin hai^TM They had 20 days given to them to give a response and they be like “oh we don’t have one” and the court is like oh sed we’ll listen to it in 2 weeks. Indian Judiciary. Very Nice👍 >The medical plea was sought on the grounds that he has been suffering from Parkinson’s Disease and has almost lost hearing from both ears. He has fallen in jail multiple times and has been operated for hernia twice and still has pain in his lower abdomen. Shame on us. Shame on me for ever believing that BJP will bring change.. Shame on our courts for asking NIA if they can give a straw or not and giving 20days to answer. Why is he even in jail? If he is so dangerous then why not put him under house arrest? Such shitty time for our country.. These are the moments which make me feel like shit about living in India Maybe we should all order straws and sippers to the NIA headquarters and field offices Ye kya chutiyapa hai bc. Kya matlab? 100rs me milte hai, laake dedo na. Bhai ye kya chutiyapa hai seriously. Sick and tired of this nation. Even Kasab was treated better than him.  The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday told a special NIA court that they don't have a straw and sipper to give 83-year-old Bhima-Koregaon violence accused Father Stan Swamy a sipper and winter clothes. Swamy had filed an application seeking permission to allow him a glass as he cannot hold a glass because he has Parkinson's Disease. The matter will be heard on December 4.

This is how they are labelling protests of the farmers in the media.,,Policy/Economy," This is not surprising at all. Even the cops are treating these protestors differently. 

Yogendra Yadav described a case in Haryana recently. Farmers were protesting against the recent Farm Bills. Someone from BJP decided to take out a tractor rally to in support of the bills. Both the groups came in front of each other on the road. The protestors were standing on the side of the road and showing black flags to this tractor rally. Unfortunately, one person sitting on the tractor suffered a heart attack during this. The entire thing was captured on video. The person was taken to the hospital and was proclaimed dead.

Remember that the people on tractors were supporters of the bills. It was a rally initiated by BJP. 

Next we know, the cops charged the farmers who were protesting on the side of the road with 'murder' and arrested 7 people.

This is crazy. They are trying to suppress all protest through whatever means they can. 

[Here is Yogendra Yadav talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifrpM89fYT8)

Edit: Grammar and removed a few redundant words. Indian media is an enemy of the people Tractor jihad. As a Punjabi, I'm not surprised. I am not. 

It's easy for the media to label all farmers as Khalistani militants but what they don't know is that the Punjabi's are seriously fed-up this time. 

As long we serve the Army and Government, we are considered as loyal but when we ask for our rights and respect from the government - we are simply labeled as terrorists. 

Not surprised, this has happened before with us . Wouldn't be surprised that this government would frame us as the ""enemy of the nation"" again.

P.S - To those who think these protests are funded by Congress or AAP, they are not. In fact, the same farmers are abusing Capt. Amarinder Singh for his ineptitude. I remember a farmer burning a dummy, which had pictures of both Modi and Captain pasted together.

Also, Rahul Gandhi came here to rally, but he couldn't even find enough farmers to support him, simply because the farmer unions didn't want him here. Same with the Akali Dal. No surprise that Rahul didn't come here again. At the same time, many BJP leaders in Punjab have resigned from their party.

These protests are not political and don't make it one. There are more than 1,50,000 farmers protesting. When you begin to think they cannot stoop any lower, They surprise you with their shamelessness. Jihadi , khalistani , missionary , urban naxals , anti nationals  

What else does BJP use to frame others ? how do these chomus even come up with this Do those media channels have any proofs ? If not then this is fake news. Start a Twitter campaign against them. If people are not speaking then these media channels will continue to spread fake news and earn TRP. This news channel shouldn’t consume anything produced by farmers then! my expectations for these people are low but holy fuck!!! and to think some people will actually eat this shit like a hot chocolate baffles my mind When Muslims protest, they’re jihadis. When Sikhs protest, they’re Khalistanis. When Christians protest, they’re tied to missionary activities. When liberal Hindus protest, they’re urban naxals who are traitors to the community. I say that everyone here get used to these terms, because they’re not going away for a while. Translation please Can’t anyone put a case on them? For spreading fake news? Why were you watching tv9 is the bigger question Disappointed but not surprised. I wonder how these reporters live with themselves, knowing that they are fully or at least in part complicit in crimes against their own countrymen. Jab jaat logo ne poora haryana jala diya tha tab to sarkar se jhaant na hua tha,ab tear gas ke gole fenk rahe hai aur protestors ko khalistaniyon ka naam dediya.

I’m taking bets on what our next khatra would be!! Yesterday love jihad, today farm jihad , tommorow tractor Jihad  , then u r civil liberties, then they willl boycott farmer's then they eat shit everything will be happy by themselves facists I want you all to remember that same thing happened in 1982 too, when Akali Dal was going to Delhi to protest in front of Asian Games. Haryana Government of Bhajan Lal (Congress), humiliated, bullied and brutalized Sikhs. That was a major major turning point acknowledged among Sikh historians. Only difference is no media covered it accurately then, right now every thing is playing very minutely on social media channels even if MSM is not covering it appropriately. People in general and Sikhs can see through this charade. Where's Arnab when ~~you~~ they need him most? Hey! I genuinely don't get what the fuss is about on the Farmer's bill, I have absolutely no knowledge on this topic, the sources I know are all based and right-leaning. Could someone please explain in a civil manner without putting your emotions first (I could get that on media outlets) why this bill is bad

P.S. I'm not looking for an argument, and I am not a BJP supporter To fir ye Khalistan wale to achche log honge... Holy shit. This is what Chomsky was talking about in his book. Feel like we live in Nazi Germany Wow!! The title is cracking and ironical "" kyonki hamein desh ki PADI"". South Indian here...I haven't  learnt Hindi. Can anyone Translate this please? The playbook of every fascist mother fucker. We literally have the worst media in the world, like Trump calls his media the worst but they are not even close to how bad, like piece of shit our media is, if I see one of these Anchors(I live in Noida) I will be having a bit of talk with them, asking stuff like how do you sleep at night? This and CAA, Tablighi and Hathras from some of them saw shitty reporting Anyone find this surprising.

It's in these situations that true colours are revealed Smh Can someone provide a 101? Why only farmers from Punjab are protesting? Bengal, Kerala - where are their farmers? First of all Khalistan is sikh related and not pakistan related and it's not terrorist related it's justice related tbh these are the same guys that vote for this kind of politics.

Except for people like Zoya Akhtar or Farah Khan or Meghna Gulzar. But that's like saying Indira Gandhi made it to the top. They were very capable individuals who got these oppurtunities only because of their families. Their privilege protected them from discrimination of a society they never had to fight.

If there are 50% women in the country but everyone has to watch content from the POV and fantasy of men, it affects how the country looks at the other gender. Ultimately leading to unrealistic behavioural expectation and sexual harrassment too imo. 

And if you still prefer movies like Kabir Singh where in the very first scene the woman agrees to go out with a complete dickhead and stranger to some remote farm where he wants to tutor her?? Youre poop. Real life women dont do that. Stop watching these movies. Support and share the better and more realistic movies.

Soooo, if an experiment gone wrong in a city in China can make the world stop, what do you know, maybe you'd help reducing crimes against women by watching and sharing non poopy content.

Edit: Spellings",Culture & Heritage ," A three year public protest,loud and angry united front by women expressed by refusing to get married no matter what,would scare the shit out of many people in this country and help women identify allies within their ranks who arent just paying lip service to their feminism to gaslight them,whether they be male or female.


Just saying. cause almost every block faced by women in our short sighted petty society,is done in the name of good/bad intentions,that is- "" we are protecting their value for marriage""

I kinda agree with you here, *but also not really.*

>If there are 50% women in the country but everyone has to watch the POV and fantasy of men, it effects how the country looks at the other gender. ultimately leading to sexual harrassment too imo.

Every industry is accustomed to a certain way of working. 

* Creators are accustomed to making such content, because that what people want to watch. 
* People are accustomed to watching such content, because that what creators are making.

It's an endless cycle. **The issue here is the feedback loop is flawed**. Investors are afraid to invest in an experiment, and as a result people never get to vote towards an alternative.

In this cycle some people because a lot wealthy, and powerful. 

And when you try to change anything in such a powerful industry, you are blocking money from some very wealthy and powerful individuals. 

We need smarter people to navigate through change, but one thing is for sure, *change is inevitable*.

&#x200B;

About a year ago I read this quote on some subreddit. And I think it's important to consider it while we move forward.

>*When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like opression.*

&#x200B;

The world of entertainment is moving to OTT and VOD. More platforms like SonyLiv, Hotstar etc., are going to surfacing in the coming years.

And besides increasing the reach for uncharted regions, OTT has one huge benefit. **Shorter Feedback loop**.

If you have ever seen analytics for youtube you'll know what I am talking about.

&#x200B;

Those smart people I talked about 4 lines ago, they need to learn about how the new world operates.

Here's a fun fact:

* previously, ""ticket bookings"" at theatres was mainly the only metric considered to declare a movie as a success. ^(They also considered 'how many people didn't get back to theatres after the interval' but I have no idea what I am saying on the topic of Theaters and how they function.)
* OTT is great for consumers because it gives the creators a deeper and richer insight.
* Say viewer does the following:
   * watched a movie for the first 10 minutes and close the browser,
   * Fast forward too much through the movie,
   * Switched to another movie midway on the same platform,
   * Went to another streaming platform after reading movie bio,
* All these signals as a negative impression on the movie.
* Basically, letting the creators and the investors know: **People didn't like what you made.**

People in theatres would sleep through the boring parts, but on OTT, consumers have low patience. They'll either forward or close it entirely. We as consumers have more options.

**Use these tools on your hand as your weapon, and let the creators know what type of content you want to watch.**

&#x200B;

Well, that's for OTT. What about other content released in theatres? You can still use the internet to signal your content.

* Downvote the trailer and title songs on youtube *(Remember Beyonce sharma jayegi?)*
* Write a blog post about it,
* downvote movie on Google Search result.
* Write your review on IMDB

Make your voice heard.

# Why Women Can't Make Movies

First of all, that not true. As you have listed out some really high-quality content made by creators who happened to be women. Let's Just call them creators and not female creators.

**I have a few uplifting facts/news for you**

\- **India has patriarchy past** and it's justified because it *worked* back then. With our newly gained freedom, we took 3 generations to realise we should be investing our money. India as a country is very young. (we are relatively new to independence compared to how long civilisation has flourished on this land)

Things are changing though, but it'll take time. India is a huge country with millions of people with 1000s of unique cultures.

\- **We live in a Digital Economy.** Our lives have changed in 2020. Covid-19 has accelerated digital adoption by at least 5 years. We have a long way to go, but all in good time.

*Now here's the thing about the digital economy,* ***it's permissionless.***

If you are a talented creator, all you need is a decent computer to edit and a camera to record. Heck, today even the phones are powerful enough to record high-quality content. Just create it and show it to the world.

If they haven't been involved in any violence, neither in any form - what are the reasons to stop them from marching towards Delhi? How the fuck does a state government owns the highway or state borders? 

The time ain't far when you all would see the Orwellian prediction from his book 1984 turn into the reality. You know what is happening in short?

I guess these are the reasons behind stopping the march.

Father Stan Swamy, the 83-year-old tribal rights activist arrested last month over his alleged involvement in the Bhima-Koregaon case, will have to wait till at least next Friday for a straw and a sipper cup which he needs as a Parkinson's Disease patient and winter clothes. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has filed a reply on the petition of Swamy seeking the return of the sipper.

Does India fall into the 3rd world countries?,"According to google the third world countries are one's who had a role in WW1 & WW2 and got defeated and left themselves in poverty but as we know India didn't had a great role in WWs but as the image of India the world has some Western countries do think it is the third world.

What do you think?",AskIndia," Its just NATO - Communist bloc and NAM respectively for 1st, 2nd and 3rd.

Now used in terms of development alone. The First/Second/Third world labels were coined during the Cold War and tbh, most political scientists don’t use them anymore bc they grossly oversimplify the differences and similarities between states.

Basically, the first world is made up of western capitalist countries (the USA side of the Cold War, if you will), and the second world is communist countries (aka the Soviet Bloc) and the third word is everyone else. So yes, India is in the third world, technically. 

However, it’s also an NIC and a rising power with a rapidly growing middle class that’s responsible for more and more of the global economy so referring to it as a third world country isn’t exactly useful to political scientists.

Nowadays, the third world is considered just any developing state, but once again, most political scientists prefer not to use this categorization because it treats every developing country the same when they are very much not.  

TL;DR yes but the “first vs second vs third world” system is an outdated remnant of the Cold War I don't get why WW has any influence now. Japan and Germany were defeated. France was demolished and humiliated by Nazis.
All these 3 countries are developed and wealthy now. We were not a sovereign nation during the world war.. Indian soldiers fought for Britain in WW2 .. Meaning of a term often changes with time. In today's world the 1st world means rich developed nations like USA, Canada, West European nations, Japan, Australia, New Zealand etc.

The 2nd world now means nations which are close to be a developed nation like China, East European nations, Russia, Turkey, Arab nations, Argentina, Taiwan, Malaysia, etc.

The 3rd world nations are poor nations with low HDI  and widespread poverty like most African nations or South Asian countries. The word origin does not hold meaning anymore. There is no rigid definition. It changes over time.

In present context third word countries are developing countries with low human development, extensive poverty, high population, high income inequalities etc.

According to the present context, India perfectly falls into third world countries. first,second, third world countries are terms used during cold war so the countries who supported capitalism(USA) are first world, the countries supporting communalism (USSR) are second world and the rest neutral are third world countries. It's a vague term overall. From a political perspective, the countries that didn't side or didn't align upfront with either NATO or the  Warsaw Pact, are considered third world countries. India qualifies as a third world country here.

Now the term is(from what I have seen) used for countries that have a sizable population living in poverty and overall lack of infrastructure, basically underdeveloped(Likes of Somalia, Laos). But here, there's' no clear definition of the first and the second world.

The term is vague as I said before and its usage is entirely context dependant. This concept came during cold war, not during world wars. US and its allies were considered as the first world. Soviets and its allies were considered as the second world. All the other countries were considered as the third world. > India didn't had a great role in WWs  

Well the British empire had used around 1.5 million soldiers from the Indian army in the first world war,  and around 2.5 million in the second. Quite significant I would say... It's just that twe didn't learn about it in history, and the british considered Indian army as disposable toy soldiers.."
Indian wedding 'rules' can go fuck themselves,"Context: Brother got married yesterday (by choice) with full religious rites (against his choice). They have also officially registered the wedding. This is a love marriage in a metropolitan city. 

Our marriage rituals go from quirky old to inhumanely archaic. 
The entire host of touching object X to object Y while muttering words no one understands rule. The wake up at ungodly hour and fast for the rest of the day rule. The young person cannot pay respects to ancestors, but enfeebled, arthritic father can rule. The bride breaking earthen disks to signify breaking 'her seal' rule. The aunts who need to know if they previously ""had an affair"". Oh, and every other rule which I don't know because we're 'progressive'. 

But the straw that breaks the camels back:
They (both 30+) cannot share a room tonight for reasons which I (25+) ""cannot understand"".

I was excited for this wedding. I wanted my brother to have an amazing time. Now I just want to sit by a pond by myself. What is wrong with the people of my country?

Edit: people seem to misunderstand who this rant is aimed at. For the most part, it's not the 1% of the BS which we (me, my brother) have to endure. It's the rest of the 99% which most others have to endure. And the culture which let's this BS live and flourish.",Culture & Heritage ," >Now I just want to sit by a pond by myself. What is wrong with the people of my country?

Same Elders in the group must be respected. /s I think I'll go to a pond now. lmaaaaooo retards everywhere. Even the kids are not strong enough to say fuck off to their parents and whoever. Ignorance and arrogance is what wrong with people of indian subcontinent I'm out of the loop here but what are the reasons for not allowing to share room. Could be a stretch, but would it be possible for you to inquire from perhaps an cool old lady or dude, to whom no one listens, but is actually ahead of his time in thinking. I mean, I can only hope there might be atleast one of them, who would be open to satisfy a young one's curiousity such as yourselves. Try it out. Without a judgement and with an open mind that perhaps all oldies in your family or friends would be retards. With the emphasis on the word ""open mind"".

Even I am curious about the earthen disks and not sharing the room thing? Could you tell what state/community are you talking about? Now I am so confused. I am an Indian, Hindu. Most of the stuff that you mentioned isn’t practiced in my community!! cool

but you are not giving your elders the credit* they deserve- they atleast allowed the couple to go ahead with a love marriage. That's something I'm not allowed to have. The chanting and proceedings are fine (other than breaking the seal stuff) but who asks if you have slept with someone before I be fucking  tf do you care Hey any pond in mind think I might just join you there 🤪 Or you know be an adult and put your foot down. 

If you cant find the courage to speak up to your parents, you should not be getting married. Don't disrespect the culture. That is not allowed by Indian culture... I guess it's wasier to say this when you're priveleged but you really need to stand up to your folks if you want to being about these changes. Brother had a 5 minute non-religious wedding presided over by my father's professors from graduate school. Not as quick as some mallu weddings but got over with minimum fuss If you can't handle it then ignore it. What else can you do? A wedding is a special occasion for the entire family. All members can't just abolish the rituals they believe in just because you don't like them."

Case registered against BJP MP Tejaswi Surya (in file photo) for entering Hyderabad's Osmania University without taking prior permission from the university authorities. The University Registrar had complained against him: Telangana DGP,,Politics," It's a stupid case. But I am from Osmania university. Our university's two mains gates have been completely closed from March end (i.e., because of the lockdown). There is another side gate available for anyone to enter if they have any work. This idiot deliberately choose the locked gate, spread fake news that they locked the gates to stop him, removed the obstacles at that gate and entered without permission. 

1. He thinks too much of himself. No one gives a fuck to some small random neta from a different state who came here only because of the elections. The government wouldn't even try to stop him lol. 

2. We, the students are extremely fed up with every party trying to use the university for getting votes. This applies to the TRS as well. No one cares about our university when there are no elections. This is just calling for criticism Meh unimportant person charged for unimportant reason...

and also it was meant to say 'what happens here' not 'her' 

\---

If it's positive what happens, what are the laws in India, I know it's strict entering the country if you have a diagnosis of HIV they don't allow you to enter.

So what happens if you test positive while there on holiday, will they ask her to immediately leave?",Non-Political," I don't think they will ask her to leave. Also, did she take just the screening test, or confirmatory too? Please advice her to not to rush to a hospital because of the pandemic, and go to an out patient facility for AIDS/or consult online and figure out what to do next. Confirmatory tests are only done in govt recognised lab and centres. She must have already undergone pretest counselling.

Being HIV positive does not mean one is suffering from AIDS. Medication must have already been started as post- exposure prophylaxis.
Symptoms related to HIV are not apparent even after 2/3 years of getting infected. Initial symptoms can be as vague as weakness or fatiguability to frequent infections like flu/TB because of lowered immune response.

Unless she is symptomatic to the extent of being deemed unfit to travel ( unlikely), there shouldn’t be any reason to restrict air travel.
Yes, she is high risk for covid and air travel can be risky. 

There are no travel restrictions or mandatory HIV testing for people traveling to India. You will have to check with the country she will be travelling back to. > I know it's strict entering the country if you have a diagnosis of HIV they don't allow you to enter.

That sounds extreme. Why would they have a law like that? There are no laws about HIV positive people entering or leaving India. I don't know of any country that does either. It's not like COVID where you can infect others just by breathing.

She should figure out where she wants to be treated, India or her home country. Her health and safety should be first priority - she should talk to a doctor first. Literally the first thing that comes up when you Google.     
     
“ There are no restrictions for HIV positive visitors. No questions relating to a potential HIV infection are asked when individuals apply for a visa, residency or work permit.”      
    
http://hivtravel.org/Default.aspx?PageId=143&CountryId=87 The authorities asking her to immediately leave is probably the least of the problems when someone has contracted HIV? India doesn't have any health related rules especially for HIV + tourists. Only highly communicable diseases such as Yellow fever, polio, etc are given scrutiny. But people can get discriminatory so ask her not to disclose it with non medical professional and non sex partners.  

Even with no protection, the chances for HIV transmission from a positive person to the recipient person in vaginal intercourse is well below 1%. It will be a good idea to get tested again. Who was the guy she had sex with and why?"

They don't even listen to people unless you make trouble for them like stopping highways, railway tracks, and when you do that you have to face water cannons, tear gas. 

If our people were armed, the govt couldn't do shit without people's consent. And the current arms law is a version of imperial idea of disarming people to rob them the ability to fight back.

Midnight Detention Of Over 100 Farmers: Punjab & Haryana High Court Issues Notice To Haryana Govt.

BJP in 2020 : haha water cannon goes brrr.. farमर Ye naya Bharat hai. Ye apne annadaata ko bhool chuka hai. RSS goons will pretend to be farmers and derail the agitation by engaging in violence. Be careful about those turds. I genuinely don't understand how people have become so numb to this, though. 

I blame the media and the way it's shaped our discourse to become so bloody toxic. The way it labels the opponents of the government. The way those labels are then used to dehumanise or delegitimize their opponents making any kind of violence against them justifiable. 

For farmers, the label is 'misguided'. The minute they cast that label on them, it removes the need to negotiate with them because the label has created this idea that farmers don't have the requisite intellectual capacity to form their own ideas and so are easily led astray. If they no longer need to speak to them, they no longer need to consider their pleas. So, water cannons are now fair game. 

So bloody insidious. So bloody effective. Incredibly sad, though. Protesting is constitutional right they should be ashamed to stop em , blasting water in winter such a shame , the country which says ""jai jawan jai kisan"" enacting this shit laws means they will never care about ppl they care about mega corps , they have been protesting against em for month's no wide spread covarage being done by majority of the news/media , they played games before just to get into power (& propaganda)  now they will not go away because ppl are believing in their shitty stuff , the economy estimate to shrink 10%(IMF) , hundreds of millions are unemployed , botched pandemic response , no vaccination strategy & didn't procured like most countries did like 2× to 6× than their intended population+ booster shot , talks with Chinese but bj0 claims no one came into indian territory (1100sqkm gone ) , a normal  person will not get vaccinated before 2022 for sure , democracy rankings 27 to 51 (yr '14 to '20) , 94/107  hunger index , , ,20k crore package no where to see(average resident) ,  if still ppl are supporting facists/Nazis , the infamous love jihad no legal basis (under indian constitution)  &  use of uapa sedition for journalist and activists , rampaged propaganda fake news , bought news , many human rights organisations are leaving , ohhh they go about religion  on and on creating division between ppl , I can rant but I don't wanna so stop supporting em dumb morons Sabkha vishwas indeed Look at this, Sanghis are pretending to be farmers and pelting stones in front of camera.

Under MSP farmers get Rs1864 /100 kg for paddy, which is almost Rs 20/ kg. I buy  a 50 kg Rice sack for Rs 2000 in Bengal, which is Rs 40/kg . Which is quite reasonable.
